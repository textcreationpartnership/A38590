            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>eſty, in the next place I bring them to you for yours: and I-beſeech your Highneſſe with all the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and humility I can, that you will be pleaſed to accept as fauourably, as I hope he hath done of them. It is the Doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt that deſireth your protection. A ſubiect too ſublime to be handled by my inſufficiency, or to neede to be protected by any; but that
<pb facs="tcp:98706:4"/>the preſent ſtate of England required this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of mee, and it to be more acceptable ſtoode neede of your protection. This I inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly confeſſe to be the true and onely motiue why next vnto God I dedicate my worke to your Highneſſe. Becauſe ſetting forth this methode of doctrine, which the Councell of Trent hath ſoe earneſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and which is practiſed with ſoe much profit in ſome places, and not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the English tongue, I haue done il ſoe, as I thought was ſitteſt for England; yet not ſoe but that I know a powerfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour to be both ſeaſonable and neceſſary to make it more acceptable. And therefore as I was carefull that it should haue a more then ordinary approbation before it entred the preſſe; ſoe now comming forth in publicke, I deſire it should goe vnder your name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thinke none ſoe powerfull to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende it to the vſe and profit of others, as your Highneſſe.</p>
            <p>You are the Higheſt of all English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes. You are ſette in our Crowne as a gemme of ſingular luſtre, and our eyes and harts are filled with the expectation of you; the wiſdome of your Father, which the world in due time shall admire, and the piety of
<pb facs="tcp:98706:4"/>your Mother, whom the moſt turbulent of times could neuer taxe, meeting both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt in you. For you are the firſt of the Royall ſtocke of England that now for many yeares, and for ſome deſcents hath profeſſed the Catholike Faith, brought vp by ſpeciall prouidence in the boſome of the Catholike Church, that we may ſay of you as of Iacob,
<note place="margin">Gen. 48.</note> 
               <hi>God hath fed you from your youth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this preſent day,</hi> as though deſigned to ſome eminent happineſſe. To whom then shall the Catholike Doctrine in English ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe it ſelfe, but vnto you? Where shall it finde a Patrone, if you should reiect it? <hi>A prudent hart shall poſſeſſe knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and the eare of the wiſe doth ſeeke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> This is the doctrine which your eare hath harkened vnto, which you poſſeſſe in your hart; and your Diuine Spouſe doth require that you outwardly profeſſe what your hart poſſeſſeth, and putte him as a ſeale both vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hart, and vpon your arme.</p>
            <p>The afflicted Catholikes of England will reuiue with ioy, to ſee this Doctrine publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your hands, and will take it as a pledge of greater felicity, which from your neereſt Progenitour they, may well expect. I will ſpeake here the truth which I haue ſpoken
<pb facs="tcp:98706:5"/>vnto many; that when I read in S. Bede the conuerſion of the English, and ſaw S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine graciouſly receiued by King Ethelbert well diſpoſed to his doctrine by hauing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried à Catholike, who was daughter of France, it made then ſuch impreſsion in mee, and gaue ſuch liuely hopes of the like benefit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that a ſmall knowledge in hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented preſently ſome other ſuch marriages to mee, by which I beganne to conceiue it as a bleſsing vpon France, that the <hi>Flower de Luces</hi> should ſend forth the odour of Chriſt vnto other nations, the Catholike Doctrine comming from thence for their conuerſion. The firſt-fruits of theſe hopes we haue all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in you, and by this they will grow, and increaſe in vs.</p>
            <p>Beſides this booke beeing ſoe directed to Catholikes, as by the way to giue ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all other Religions that shall meete with it: I was to ſeeke for ſuch a Patrone as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offenſe to any might ingratiate it to all: and for this there was none ſoe proper as your ſelfe, who as yet in the candour of your Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, are gratefull to all Chriſtians, and by your vnſpotted innocency to all the world. Grant then <hi>(moſt Gracious Princeſſe)</hi> your deſired Patronage, which is ſoe proper
<pb facs="tcp:98706:5"/>and neceſſary to this worke, that I neither will, nor can in reaſon looke for any other. What Englishmans hart (tender by nature) will not ſo farre reſent your condition and his owne, as at leaſt to receiue and reade that which commeth commended by you for the good of his ſoule? It vill goe for pure gold when you haue accepted of it: vnder your Name and character all will receiue and reade it, and with Gods aſsiſtance shall profit by it. This is the cauſe why I dedicate it firſt to God, and then to you; deſiring no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my ſelfe, but your gracious acceptance for the good of others. Becauſe for a booke to doe much good, I conſider it as neceſſarie, to procure that it be currently accepted of, and much read, as it is to contriue, and compoſe it good in it ſelfe. And hauing now prouided as well as I can for both, I haue done all, and will reſt,</p>

            <head>A PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great want of inſtruction which I ſaw in many mouing mee to apply my ſelfe more ſeriouſly to the practiſe of catechizing, I tooke into my hands that Catechiſme which the Councell of Trent cauſed to be made, and was ſettforth by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande of Pius Quintus Pope, and is commonly called the ROMANE CATECHISME. Which as it hath the authority not of ſome one authour onely, but was made by expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of an intire, and that ſoe flourishing a Generall Councell, it may iuſtly take place of all other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmes, and is of all others the moſt worthy to be followed. And it added not a litle to the eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me which I had of that booke to vnderſtande af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that it came cheifly by the care and pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that bleſſed man, and late mirrour of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors S. Charles Borromaeus.</p>
            <p>The firſt thinge which I obſerued in it was an earneſt deſire, and almoſt continuall exhorting of paſtors to the catechizing of their people. This it commendeth not onely once of purpoſe in the beginning, but all ouer in euery cheife ſubiect: which it treateth, and almoſt in euery thinge which it mentioneth it repeateth, and inculcateth
<pb facs="tcp:98706:10"/>ouer againe the neceſſity of inſtruction alſo in that particular point: that it is a thinge very remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſee the great zeale of this holy Councell, in ſoe often commending, and recommending to Paſtors the inſtruction of their people. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Sacraments beginning to ſpeake of Baptiſme, it ſayth that Paſtors should neuer thinke that they had ſaid enough in declaration of that Sacrament; and exhorteth them that not onely on the Eues of Eaſter and whitſunday, when it is adminiſtred with greater ſolemnity, but alſo at other times that they take occaſion when they ſee a good number of people together at the baptizing of any, to ſay ſomething if not of all the cheife parts of it, at leaſt of ſome one or other point of it, as opportunity shall permitte. And in another place (as I remember) it exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to haue certaine commune places in their memory for the explicating of any part of the Chriſtian doctrine, as neede shall requite. This was the firſt thinge which I could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in the Romane Catechiſme, and which ought to be a great incitement, eſpecially to the Paſtoral Clergy to whom it was directed, and who haue by office the charge of ſoules, to attende earneſtly to doctrine. And indeede he that before God hath vndertaken this charge, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on one ſide the dignity, and neceſſity of the Chriſtian Doctrine in it ſelfe; and on the other ſide the ignorance of many, and the ſtupid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of their ſoules which is cauſed by it, will eaſily ſee what obligation he hath to vſe his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeauours by all methods and wayes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:98706:10"/>to attende to it; but eſpecially in that, which by the ſanctity, wiſdome, and autority of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell is commended.</p>
            <p>I will not here omitte to propoſe the Clergy of France for an example, and eſpecially thoſe about Paris, in all Eccleſiaſticall perfections the glory of Chriſtendome; who conſidering the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Doctrine to be the firſt ground of ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, haue ſett themſelues ſoe earneſtly to inſtruct in it, as though the words of the Apoſtle were allwais in their eares <hi>Attende to thy ſelfe and to doctrine: be earneſt in them</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>Woe to the paſtors of Iſrael which fedd themſelues</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But my flocke you fedd not.</hi> How many ſeuerall inſtitutions haue of late yeares bene there erected for this purpoſe? How many congregations of Prieſts are now eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Parish Churches of the citty for educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Paſtoral Clergy, and with ſpeciall care to the Chriſtian doctrine? What methods haue they deuiſed? what a number of books haue they ſettforth? How many litle papers haue they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed amongſt the people? and what extreme and continuall paines doe they take, to inculcate that by word of mouth, which they deliuer in writing. It is an admirable thinge, and full of aedification to ſee the ſweat and toile, which I haue ſeene in thoſe graue and excellent men. Nay that nothing might be left vneſſayed by them, they haue cauſed the cheife points of the Chriſtian doctrine to be put into verſe for the eaſyer learning of it without booke. But that which is yet of more moment, and moſt worthy
<pb facs="tcp:98706:11"/>to be practiſed all ouer the Catholike Church, is an exerciſe confirmed by authority as I perceiue all ouer France, which they call the Prone or Pronaum, as being deliuered in the Naue or open of the Church; in which euery Sunday at High Maſſe the Creede being ended, the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brant or ſome other for him aſcendeth the pulpit, and ioyning prayer with the people for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitys of the Catholike Church, for the Popes Holineſſe, the ſoules in Purgatory, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affaires that occurre; the Chriſtian doctrine is then read to them, and a ſpeech or Sermon is commonly made vpon ſome part of it. Is not this a zeale worthy of Catholike Prieſts, of the ſoules of Chriſtians, which they muſt anſwere for, of the dignity of that doctrine which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe? Why doe not all then imitate this zeale in them? That which they doe in this Prone is but in proſecution of the Councell of Trents deſire, and that which I here labour for. For what is my Summe of the Chriſtian doctrine, but the Creede, Sacraments, Praecepts of the Church, and the other moſt neceſſary points which firſt they reade, and what my Diſcourſes, but as theirs vpon ſome of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truely it was noe ſmall ſatisfaction to mee, when comming into France, I ſaw that which for ſome yeares I had practiſed in priuate, to be ſee publikely, and generally there profeſſed, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though vnknowne to mee. And beſides the profit which I had experienced in it, and the authority of the Romane Catechiſme, their example did not a litle encourage mee to publish it, and to commende the like practiſe to our countrey,
<pb facs="tcp:98706:11"/>which ſtandeth much more neede of it then they. And yet for all this care, and paines which they take, I haue heard them ſometimes complaine to their people, that many of them were ignorant euen in the firſt principles, and moſt neceſſary points of doctrine: and I know by ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that it was not alltogether without cauſe. But if in France, and about Paris, where ſuch care is taken, and where the common people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are to be thought more knowing then in any place of the Chriſtian world, there was reaſon to complaine; what shall we ſay of other places where that care is wanting, and where thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Catechizing are not ſoe much as thought of? By all which we may ſee the dignity and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Catechizing in the iudgment of the wiſe, and how great a falt it is in ſome of the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, who ſleight it as a thinge for children onely, and when themſelues perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in damnable ignorance.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian doctrine is the ground and foundation of religion, and the Catholike Church continueth allwais in the world by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall inſtructing in it. Chriſt the Sonne of God laid that foundation, the Apoſtles after him build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon it, the Fathers and Doctors of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church from time to time haue raiſed vp the ſtructure, and by their preachings and writings mainteined it: and for all that they haue ſaid and written, there will ſtill remaine for others to write, vntill it come to that perfection to which God hath ordained it in this world. This is that doctrine which plane humble and outwardly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable,
<pb facs="tcp:98706:12"/>but grounded vpon the promiſes of Ieſus-Chriſt, auncient Philoſophy could not withſtande it. This doctrine deliuereth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of diuinity, it hath beaten downe infidelity, diſperſed haereſys like ſmoke, it abolisheth ſinne, and inflameth vnto vertue the harts of thoſe that faithfully imbrace it. Finally this is <hi>the knowledge of ſaluation in which the Orient from on high hath viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs.</hi> And it should ſuffize to ſay that it is the knowledge of ſaluation. What eſteeme then ought all to haue of it? with what dillige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſtudy it, and to be perfect in it? And therefor the Councell of Trent after the deciſion of controuerſys in faith, and declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diuine truth, in the next place would prouide for Catechizing, that the true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine declared might be deliuered to the people. And for this end they cauſed the Romane Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to be made; and that not to incite Paſtors how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer to inſtruct, but to propoſe ſuch a manner of inſtuction, as was moſt propper for times of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: as it declareth of purpoſe in the Preface, where ſpeaking of the ſuttelty of haeretiks in inſinuating of their new and poyſonſome doctrines, it hath theſe words; <hi>Wherefore to apply ſome remedy to theſe pernicious euills, the Fathers of the Oecumenicall Councell of Trent haue thought it not ſufficient onely to determine the cheife points of the Catholike doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine againſt the haereſys of theſe times; but haue alſo deemed it neceſſary to ſetiforth a certaine forme, and manner of inſtructing of Chriſtian people, which in all Churches should be followed by thoſe who haue the office of a lawfull Paſtour and teacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the forme and manner of inſtructing
<pb facs="tcp:98706:12"/>which it deliuereth, it is by Diſcourſes, Speeches or Sermons made vpon ſeuerall parts of the Chriſtian doctrine; ſuch as the auncient fathers of the Church haue left of the ſame ſubiect, and haue called Homilys, which in Greeke alſo is the ſame as to ſay <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> or <hi>Sermons.</hi> And for the methode which it hath obſerued in thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, it is ſuch, that a more profitable can not be deuiſed: for by it Catholiks are ſoe taught in doctrine, that they are alſo confirmed in faith, and piouſly excited to holineſſe of life. Three principall thinges then are intended in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catechiſmes Diſcourſes. The firſt is Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ignorant, the ſecond is Confirmation of the Catholike faith, the third Aedification to good life. As for inſtruction it performeth it very abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and more at large in thoſe ſubiects which it treateth of, then other Catechiſmes commonly doe. As for the ſecond it confirmeth the Catholike doctrine, eſpecially againſt moderne hereſys, ſoe as in that breuity is very ſufficient for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of any that would haue a care of his ſoule. As for the third which is Aedification to good life, it ſometimes threateneth with ſuch zeale the iudgments of God, to make vs to feare him, and againe, when the ſubiect requireth, it layeth open ſoe efficaciouſly the bowels of his loue and mercy, to draw vs to loue him, that we haue in it not onely a Catechiſme for inſtruction; but alſo ſoe many Sermons and exhortations to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and Paſtors by following of that methode in theſe three things, may well be ſaid to pay the debt which they owe both <hi>to the wiſe and vnwiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98706:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The ſame methode of diſcourſe I deſire to obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and the ſame three things I will labour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with that ſpirit that it shall pleaſe God to giue mee. For the firſt which is inſtruction, conſidering that in the opinion of authors ſome expreſſe, and explicite knowledge of the myſterys of faith is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly neceſſary for euery one to haue; ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> neceſſary, that to thoſe that are come to the vſe of reaſon there can be noe ſaluation without it; I haue therefor collected a short and eaſy Summe or abbreuiation of the Chriſtian doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the anſweres to a few queſtions, which moe doubt but compriſeth as much, as is abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for Lay people to know, and more then authors in rigour exact of them. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then and indifferent vnderſtanding of that Summe shall ſatisfy the obligation which all haue to learne the Chriſtian doctrine, and shall excuſe them from the ſinne of ignorance which they might incurre. In which anſweres I doe not intende the rigorous definitions of thoſe things which are there asked; but onely to declare ſoe much as is neceſſary for the vnderſtanding, and in breife for the remembring of that point. This I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten explicate to the people, and procure that they haue it with them to get without booke: for I finde by experience that neither explication onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our getting ſomethinge without booke, nor the getting without booke onely, without explication is ſufficient for the people to learne the chriſtian doctrine. I haue explicated the ſame things ouer and ouer againe many times, and vntill I gaue them ſomethinge in breife for their memory, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="tcp:98706:13"/>that my labour was in a manner loſt, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with the yong and ruder ſort, who when I came to examine againe were as farre to ſeeke, as at firſt. And on the other ſide I haue knowne ſome children who through their parents care, haue knowne all Cardinal Bellarmins litle Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme without booke; yet for want of explication haue bene litle, or nothing better for it Wherfor to bring the people both to vnderſtande, and to remember the chriſtian doctrine, I was forced to vſe theſe meanes, to giue them that Summe to gett without booke for their memory and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it to them, as they doe in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rones in France: onely with this difference, that where as there the people haue onely the cheife parts of the Chriſtian doctrine read to them before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I require that they ſay it themſelues, anſwering all together alowde to the queſtions of the Summe; for by this meanes the moſt rude and ignorant hearing others anſwere, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, come in time to learne the anſweres whether they will or noe; and that much more eaſily in their owne language then thoſe who gett without booke whole pſalmes in Latine by onely hearing, and ſinging them with others in the Church. As for explication I ſometimes expounde all the Summe in breife for the ignorant, and ſometimes for the good of all I make a diſcourſe after the manner of ſome of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; either of Faith, or of the Signe of the Cros, or of ſome article of the Creede, or other part, as occaſion shall ſerue, and as is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that dayes ſolemnity.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98706:14"/>
            <p>The ſecond thinge which I labour for is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in the Catholike faith by ſuch proofs of the Catholike doctrine as may ſuffize for that purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. And that you may better vnderſtande how I proceede in this, I deſire you to take good notice in the Creede. (For in the other Diſcourſes there is noe difficulty.) For the vnderſtanding of which you are to minde well the methode which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles haue obſerued in compoſing of it, which they carried with them in their liues, and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them at their deaths, as a rule of diuine faith. Firſt againſt Atheiſts who would perſwade themſelues that there is noe God, they laid this ground <hi>I beleeue in God.</hi> Secondly againſt Pagans, who on the contrary beleeue in many Gods, they profeſſe their beleefe in one onely God <hi>the maker of heauen and earth.</hi> Thirdly againſt Iewes and Turks, and all ſuch as they foreſaw might belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in one God, yet deny Chriſt, they profeſſe their beleefe <hi>in Ieſus Chriſt the onely Sonne of God.</hi> Yet all this was not ſufficient finally to reſolue in point of faith For being that there might be ſeuerall ſorts of Chriſtians all of them beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſt, yet all could not haue the true faith of Chriſt, as being oppoſite in doctrine, and diſobedient to each others Churches; therefor it was further neceſſary that the Apoſtles should declare which of all Chriſtian Churches that were then, or might be afterwards, was the true Church of Chriſt. This they did in the ninth article, when hauing profeſſed the cheife things that concerned the B. Trinity, and the myſtery of the Incarnation, in the next place they added I beleeue <hi>the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
<pb facs="tcp:98706:14"/>Church.</hi> Here noy all controuerſys of faith should haue an end, we being allwais bounde to beleeue the Church, and in all points to refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re our ſelues with obedience to it. And if this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle had bene allwais truely obſerued, there neuer could haue bene any haereſys, nor falſe Churches of Chriſtians in the world. For if all Chriſtians had allwais kept themſelues conſtant to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church, and continued obedient, ſubmitting allwais to it, noe falſe Churches of Chriſtians could at firſt haue riſen, all of them firſt riſing in the breach of this atticle; for that they will not beleeue the Catholike Church, which is then and muſt be at all times extant, for the gouernment of the world in the true worship of God; but will follow the conceipts of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, and beginne new Churches which then are not in any place. And if we rightly conſider this article we shall finde it ſufficient to deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish amongſt all Chriſtian people that now are, which of them is for the preſent the true Church of Chriſt. For as at firſt the true Church of Chriſt was planted Catholike, that is to ſay a people all ouer and vniuerſally agreeing in the ſame faith and doctrine; and thoſe that beganne falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſtians were firſt of it, and went forth to beginne a new Church in diſobedience to it; ſoe if amongſt all the Churches of Chriſtians that are now in the world we finde one out of which they haue all gone forth; all the reſt that haue gone forth of it are falſe Churches, and that out of which they haue all gone forth muſt haue the true faith of Chriſt, and be that firſt Church which the
<pb facs="tcp:98706:15"/>Apoſtles planted, and called <hi>The Catholike Church.</hi> This argument of the Apoſtles take to proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and to prooue more at large that which they in the Creede haue but briefly profeſſed Firſt in the firſt article againſt atheiſts that there is a God. Secondly in the ſame article againſt Pagans that there is but one God. Thirdly in the ſecond arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle againſt Iewes and Turks and all that deny Chriſt I prooue the Chriſtian faith. Fourthly in the ninth article I shew, how that amongſt all the Chriſtian Churches that are in the world, there is none but the Romane (which is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catholike) that is indeede the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church; for that all other Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are in the world went firſt out of it, and beganne at ſome time in diſobedience to that Church. (And to shew this I willingly vſe the Popes autority, that the enemys of the Catholike Church may ſee the truth, and lay a ſide their auerſion from that holy ſeate which to the ruine of their ſoules they labour to diſgrace) This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inducing the verity of the Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith is as you ſee both according to the Apoſtles method, and by it the verity of all, and euery particular point of that faith is inferred. For that being once prooued to be the true Church, there needeth noe further proofe of any particular point which it teacheth, the true Church not being ſubiect to teach falſehood in particular doctrines; but all whatſoeuer is taught by it is to be receiued for the authority of God ſoe ſpeaking, and we are allwais to ſay <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church.</hi> Yet in the
<pb facs="tcp:98706:15"/>other parts of the Chriſtian doctrine when any points of controuerſy in religion occurre, I giue ſatisfaction briefly in them alſo, as the Romane Catechiſme doth; but that which I deſire moſt to ſatisfy in is the authority of the Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church prooued out of the firſt, ſecond and ninth article of the Creede, and which may be vnderſtoode by reading the ninth onely.</p>
            <p>The third thinge which I labour for in Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to good life,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27.</note> for this is the end and fruite of all, to take away ſinne We lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation when we inſtruct in the Chriſtian doctrine, and we build vpon it when we exhort to good life, this being the hight and perfection of our labors. Wherefor that you may not onely know ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely what to beleeue; but alſo how to apply practically that knowledge to the honour of God, and your aduancement in his grace, I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed many things both out of the Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, and other authors, as alſo ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of my owne certaine knowledge, which tende onely to deuotion. Thus I follow that methode which the Councell of Trent hath giuen vs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Diſcourſes of the Romane Catechiſme; adding onely the Haile Mary in the beginning of euery Diſcourſe, as a pious deuotion to implore the aſſiſtance of our B. Lady before any good exerciſe.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Diſcourſes of the Romane Catechiſme were but few, as treating onely of fower ſubiects (beſides the praeamble which it hath of faith) to wit of the Creede, of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, of the Commandements, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:98706:16"/>Pater Noſter: and thoſe alſo ſomethinge obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as not being intended by the Councell of Trent, as a Catechiſme immediatly to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but to paſtors, to giue them examples how to Catechize; and were therefor deliuered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſpeeches without titles, vntill Andreas Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius for more cleerneſſe added titles vnto them: therefor I haue treated of more ſubiects; as firſt of the Obligation which all haue to learne the Chriſtian Doctrine, of the Signe of the Cros, of the Maſſe, of the Aue Maria, of the Roſary, of the Praecepts of the Church, and of Sinne. And I haue deſtinguished the points which are treated in them by titles ſufficiently connecting the former ſenſe with that which followeth; ſoe that I hope you will haue here the ſubſtance of the Romane Catechiſme with that cleernes which Fabritius added vnto it, and alſo ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in the ſame manner handled; ſoe requiſite for all to know, that this will appeare not onely a good, but a neceſſary booke.</p>
            <p>As for the ſtile of Catechizing if it be plane and eaſy, it is propper and as it ought to be: and for this I haue laboured all that I could euen to the repearing of the ſame words often ouer of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for more cleerneſſe. That which I feare moſt is a weake and cold ſpirit which will appeare in many places of this booke; but this muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by your more feruerous deſire, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of profiting your ſelfe by it; yet the iudicious will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that tendernes of deuotion is not much obe expected where inſtruction is deliuered, much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſe where controuerſys and arguments in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb facs="tcp:98706:16"/>occurre. Yet theſe by the method of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catechiſme could not be quite omitted, and the publike neceſſity of England did require that they should come forth more at large then was neceſſary onely for Catholike aſſemblys. Therfor for this booke to be more beneficiall, euery thinge is to be ſought for in its propper place and nature; Inſtruction and Exhortation where, and as intended, to wit, onely for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks: and as for confirming the Catholike faith, he into whoſe hands it shall come, of whatſoeuer reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he be, if he deſire indeede to ſerue God, and will pray to him, I hope he shall haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Thus much for your direction in this worke, which at firſt I beganne without the leaſt thought of publishing any thinge, but onely to diſcharge my obligation, which vntill then I had not ſoe well reflected vpon; but beginning to obſcrue a great ignorance in ſome, and obſeruing it ſtill more and more, and conſidering with my ſelfe how pertinent the words of the Apoſtle are, <hi>How shall they beleeue him whom they haue not heard?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10</note> 
               <hi>and how shall they heare without a preacher?</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this the beſt, and moſt profitable manner of preaching, and applyed my ſelfe moſt to the practiſe of it. And hauing vſed it for ſome yeares I founde it ſoe efficacious to that which I deſired, that ſome of their owne accorde acknowledged to mee the benefit which they had receiued by it, and deſiring mee to publish ſomethinge of it which they might haue to reade, I brought this booke to the perfection which it hath, and was
<pb facs="tcp:98706:17"/>many wayes encouraged to grant their deſires, eſpecially by the aduice of a graue and learned Prelate who firſt to approoue of my deſigne, told mee that if he himſelfe were in England he would apply himſelfe moſt to Catechizing: and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards pervſed a great part of the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, gaue mee moſt ſatisfaction in it. Finally for the right vnderſtanding of all. I declare here that it is not my intention to giue examples vnto others how to Catechize. For that the Romane Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me hath done allready: neither would I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſoe much (although for my Summe of the Chriſtian doctrine I would willingly commende the vſe of ſuch an one gotten without booke and expounded as a foreſaid) My firſt intention is to inſtruct the ignorant, and for that I made choice of that forme which the Councell of Trent hath deliuered, and which was the ſole ſcope, and marke which it aimed at by the Romane Catechiſme: to wit, that Paſtors should vſe ſuch Catechiſticall ſermons, as might be both a Catechizing for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, an exhortation to vertue, and in times of hereſys might confute them, and confirme the Catholike faith. Which if it were practiſed as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as the holy Councell deſired, and as other preachings are (which are much leſſe neceſſary for the people) exceeding great profit, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good might be expected by it.</p>
            <p>That Catholike is very careleſſe of himſelfe, who with all this labour doth not learne and know that which is fitting, or at leaſt neceſſary to be knowne. And that Catholike who knowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h his duety to God, and hath it thus beaten into his minde, yet
<pb facs="tcp:98706:17"/>liueth as it were contemning of God, and of all remedys for his ſoule, that hauing ſinned doth not endeauour to riſe againe, and to aime at a new and vertuous life, but will continue in ſinne, and reſolue ſtill to ſinne, he deſerueth not at all the name of a Catholike. And that Chriſtian that profeſſeth himſelfe to beleeue in God, and to worship him in that faith and religion which Chriſt left to his Apoſtles, and was allwais accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ninth article of the Creede to be in the Catholike Church; yet will beginne a religion contrary to all the Chriſtian Churches in the world, or beleeue in a religion which ſoe beganne, he deſerueth not the name of a Chriſtian. And that man that being ſufficiently ſatisfyed of the true religion (and Marke that I ſay ſufficiently ſatisfyed: for euidence of reaſon is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed vpon in any religion) yet will not profeſſe it for temporall reſpects; but goeth on with a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience in the profeſſion of a falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or rather liueth like an Atheiſt, or beaſt without any religion at all, that man I know not how to call him. A miſerable wretch he is, and of all creatures out of hell the moſt miſerable, who to feede vpon the dung of the earth, ſinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, hardening his hart will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt all heauenly inſpirations. For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, and all falſe religions I haue ſaid enough in the Creede: but for him that is neither in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion an Atheiſt, nor yet hath indeede any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I know what to ſay; but to wish him to conſider with himſelfe of the power and goodnes of God, and of the euills of ſinne that depriueth
<pb facs="tcp:98706:18"/>vs of him; and let him reade the laſt Diſcourſe where I treate ſomethinge of that ſubiect. If God of his mercy viſit theſe men with ſome heauy Croſſes, and great afflictions neceſſary to draw them to his ſeruice, it is indeede a ſingular mercy by which ſometimes they are brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But in the meane time I warne theſe hard harted men that they praeſume not too farre, but that they thinke of their ſoules, and of death which in the end shall ſurpriſe them. And I will tell them one thinge which they thinke not of; that is that they are in danger of ſuddaine death: not onely as all men are, but in particular more then others; and that God hath shewed this by many examples in which ſuch kind of men haue bene ſo punished. The example of Pharao and of thouſands of the Aegyptians were enough to prooue this; who hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardened their harts againſt the manifeſt light of God, were ſuddainly ouerwhelmed in the ſea, and miſerably perished. The like examples we haue in our Kingdome (but ouer many) of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine deaths of thoſe who againſt their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue profeſſed a falſe religion. I mention one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two which happened lately in two neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to the place where I haue liued for dinerſe yeares. They had both bene Catholiks, and for plane looſneſſe and liberty of life had forſaken the Catholike Church, and gone to the Proteſtant Churches, manifeſting by many expreſſions the guilt of their owne conſciences to their intimate freinds; but continuing ſtill diſſembling in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the one of them as he was hunting fell from his horſe, and died preſently; the other who had
<pb facs="tcp:98706:18"/>engaged himſelfe further againſt the Catholike Church, and would take noe warning by his neighbors example, within a few yeares after hauing bene drinking about three or fower miles from home, in his returne was ſuddainly ſtrucke with the paines of death, fell downe, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away dead. It is ill dallying with God. <hi>Know thou and ſee,</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> INTENDE now to ſpeake of two thinges. Firſt vnto all thoſe who haue charge ouer children, and eſpecially to parents to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende vnto them the care which they ought to haue of their good education and inſtruction. Secondly to declare vnto all the obligation which they haue to learne the chriſtian doctrine. And that I may ſpeake to the honour of God, and that all may receiue that benefit which I wish them, we will ſay the Haile Mary for our bleſſed Ladyes interceſſion. <hi>Haile Mary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<note place="margin">Education of children.</note> and to propoſe him as it were vpon a ſtage, as à
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98706:22"/>true example for all laymen and married folkes to behold, and to learne at the many vertues with which he was endowed, he would beginne his commendations with the care which he had of his children; and therefor he firſt bringeth him forth riſing vp early in the morning to ſanctify them, and to offer holocauſts for euery one of them ſpeaking theſe words,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>leaſt perhaps my ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes haue ſinned and bleſſed God in there harts.</hi> This was the firſt thing which the holy ghoſt would commende in Iob, and which may well be the firſt commendation of a married man that hath children. For as marriage was firſt inſtituted for the orderly propagation of mankind, and this propagation finally ordained to the multiplying of ſoules in the ſeruice of God; ſoe the firſt and cheife end which married folkes ought to haue in marriage is to haue children to ſerue God; and there prime commendation is to ſee that their children be brought vp in the feare of him, and know how to worship and ſerue him as they ought.</p>
            <p>This obligation of the education and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of children is not onely natural in chriſtian parents; but it is alſo acceſſory vnto them by the Sacrament of Baptiſme: for the Apoſtles as the general Paſtors of the world being bounde to prouide ſufficiently for the inſtruction of all; and being themſelues more neceſſarily imployed in planting of the ghoſpell of Chriſt and conuerting of ſoules, placed others as their ſubſtitutes who should vndertake that charge and performe it for them: and therefor they inſtituted this order
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98706:22"/>in the Church, that Godfathers should be chozen at the baptizing of all chriſtians to ſupply the place of Paſtors, who as ſpiritual parents were to ſee them inſtructed in thoſe thinges which were neceſſary for them to know, that none might want ſufficient inſtruction.

It is then à great shame and as it were à double ſinne in them to be negligent in their childrens education and inſtruction.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98706:23"/>other examples of this, a litle after he relateth as large à paſſage which I will breifly rehearſe. <hi>There was ſaith he in the city à youth richly appointed to ſtudy the Greeke and Latine tongues, and had à tutour who as I perceiued had followed a monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inſtitute. I meeting one day by chance with him, asked him the cauſe why he would change the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and quietneſſe of that courſe of life for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe and trouble of à tutors place. He beganne then to tell mee how that the father of that youth being à man addicted to the glory of the world had intended his ſonne for à ſouldiers life, but his mother à pious woman diſliking of that courſe ſent (ſaid he) for mee to conferre with her: and when I came she taking her ſonne by the right hand offered him to mee. I knowing nothing of her minde meruailed at firſt what she meant to doe. My onely care (ſaid she) is for this child and I feare much the euill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which he is like to fall into, if you aſſiſt mee not; but if you will be pleaſed to take the charge of him and carry him away with you, I shall be out of feare of him and would perſwade my husband that nothing should be wanting for his allowance and good education. I deſire you therefor to take him to your charge and I referre him wholly to be directed by you. But if you deny mee this requeſt then I call God to witneſſe that I haue done my part, and I cleere my ſelfe from the blood of my child which shal be required at your hands. And this she ſaid with ſoe many teares that I could not deny to vndertake the charge ouer him.</hi> Which was (ſaith S. Iohn Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,) to good effect in the youth, his life afterwards proouing anſwerable to his education.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98706:23"/>This would the holy Doctour inſert into his works to propoſe this carefull mother as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to parents.

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sur. to.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Octob.</hi>
               </note> it was then à time of perſecution of the Catholike Church there, as it is now here, and we haue in Surius an example of thoſe times which may ſerue for our Catholiks of England to teach them to beginne by times to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their children and eſpecially in places of perſecution to grounde and confirme them well in the Catholike faith. A chriſtian woman was then apprehended and commanded to be burnt for hauing ſprinkled herſelfe and her child with the blood of martyrs. When she was tyed to the ſtake, her child (which was but fiue yeares old) ranne vp and downe asking for his mother, and came pittifully lamenting to the place where the king ſate to behold her execution. The king tooke him to him, and told him that he would be better then his mother to him, and that he should ſtay with him: but the child ſtill cryed for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and deſired to be with her. The king perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him by faire meanes offering him giftes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice him; but all was in vaine; he told him that his mother had vſed to exhort him to martyrdome,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98706:24"/>and that he would be with her. The king asked him what it was to be à martyr. The child anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (marke this anſwere) that to be à martyr was to ſuffer death for Ieſus Chriſt and to liue for euer after. The king asked him who Chriſt was? He told him that he might ſee Chriſt in the Church: meaning as à child the pictures and Crucifixes of Chriſt which were then to be ſeene in Catholike Churches: and looking downe and getting à ſight of his mother as she was tyed to the ſtake, he cryed out let mee goe, let mee goe to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when the king hindered him he told him he thought he was à Iew, and bate him by the thigh to gette away from him: at which the king in a fury pushed him away commanding one of his ſenators to take him to bring vp in the Iewish ſect. But as he was carried away he gotte from him, and running into the fireto his mother, he had his deſire which was to dy à martyr. This child if he were not capable of much of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine at that age; yet his good mother had à care to ingraft in him at leaſt ſuch à zeale and ſoe much knowledge of the faith of Chriſt that it was admirable to heare à child of ſiue yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res old to giue ſuch an anſwer to the queſtion of martyrdome, in which he publikely profeſſed the faith of Ieſus Chriſt and the aſſurance of eternall life by ſuffering death for it. Our children are as this was, then an innocent by baptiſme. But our parents are not as the mother of this child, ſoe careful to inſtruct their children; and therefor are there ſoe many weake and feeble Catholikes amongſt vs; becauſe we want inſtruction in our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98706:24"/>youth: and we want it ſoe much, that many who are paſt children know not the cheife principles of the chriſtian faith, nor thinke that they haue any obligation to learne them: which is the ground and cauſe of all their ignorance. The firſt thing therefor and moſt neceſſary for euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to know is the obligation which he hath to learne the chriſtian doctrine. Tell mee then.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>What obligation haue chriſtians to learne the chriſtian doctrine?</hi> Anſwer. <hi>Euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound vnder a mortal ſinne to know the cheife points of the chriſtian faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an obligation vnder à mortal ſinne: that is to ſay à deadly ſinne: à ſinne by which our ſoules incurre death: as great an obligation as can be. The reaſon is becauſe all that are come to the vſe of reaſon are bounde not onely to an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual faith ſuch as children haue; but alſo to an actual faith: that is to produce acts of faith: and actual faith ſuppoſeth ſome knowledge of what is to be beleeued; and therefor euery one muſt haue ſome knowledge of thoſe thinges which he is to beleeue. Children before they come to the vſe of reaſon haue onely the habit of faith which is giuen them in baptiſme; and this is ſufficient to ſaue them that can haue noe more: but when they come to the vſe of reaſon, then they come to the vſe of their faith, and are bounde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert themſelues to à ſupernatural end, by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing acts of faith, and of the loue of God; which they can not doe except they know ſomething of him; and therefor S.

            <p>Vnder three titles I wil comprehende all that is neceſſary to be ſaid of this. In the firſt place I will shew how that faith is à ſupernatural light and gift of God. In the ſecond I will shew how that this ſupernatural light and gift of God is all wais with obedience to the Church. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by theſe two titles the nature of faith be ſufficiently declared, and in all points we shall reſt ſatisfyed with the authority of the Church; yet I will adde one title more for the good of thoſe that are out of the Catholike Church, in which I will shew how this ſupernatural light and gift of God directing to the true Church is to be ſought for and obtained by them.</p>

God hauing ordained all creatures to his ſcruice ſerues himſelfe of them according to their nature. He appointeth vnto euery one its prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office and ſetteth it within the limits of its owne ſphaere: out of which of it ſelfe it can not paſſe. Now the moſt bleſſed viſion of God in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is obtained by true faith and the loue of him is ſupernatural to vs; and therefor is not to be attained vnto by the light of natural reaſon, as being out of that ſphaere. Seeing, hearing and feeling are in different ſphaeres; and therefor they can not reach into, nor medle with each others of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. The ſight tends to colours, the hearing to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98706:27"/>ſoundes, the feeling to palpable thinges, and they keepe themſelues within their owne ſphaeres. We ſee not voices, we heare not the light nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, nor doe we feele either of them. Children and fooles catch at shaddowes, and hearing the Eccoès which their voyces make, they looke about to ſee them. But wiſemen know that this is foolish. Why? becauſe they are in different ſphaeres. Euen ſoe it is à childish and foolish thing for men to ſtudy by natural reaſon to comprehende the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterys of faith and to thinke by the natural light of humane faith to attaine to ſupernatural glory; there being à farre g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly we ſee that there are many natural thinges which we can not vnderſtande; much leſſe then should we thinke to comprehende the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterys of diuine faith.

All which thinges and many more hath God concealed from vs to keepe vs in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and shall we thinke to make the myſterys of faith to be ſubiect to our vnderſtandings? We know not how the parts of a litle chippe or ſtraw are continuated together, and the beſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers acknowledge their ignorance in it, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe God that hath humbled them in thoſe obuious thinges, and shall we preſume vpon the myſterys of faith?

Then for the learneder ſort they ſee that the faith of Chriſt by the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical writings that are in all the world is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced euer from the beginning of the world vntil the comming of Chriſt, and euer ſince his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it is deduced vnto vs in none but in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98706:32"/>Church of Rome: and all other Churches of chriſtians hauing goneforth of it, they muſt either be haeretical or ſchiſmatical Churches, or els there can be noe haeretical nor ſchiſmatical Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world. Theſe are ſufficient motius to an vnderſtanding man to thinke by reaſon that the Romane Church hath the true faith which God will haue him to belseue, and is the true Church which he will haue him to obey. Yet if we had not the ſupernatural light and inſpiration of God mouing vs to that faith; but that we were to goeby our owne thoughts onely, then were it not a ſupernatural faith of abſolute and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty, as not proceeding from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, nor had it proportion to ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural glory.

               <p>BY that which hath bene ſaid it doth appeare that faith is not a natural, but a ſupernatural light and gift of God, now we will shew that by it we are allwais to adhaere and firmely to beleeue the doctrine of the Church; which is the ſecond part of that which you haue anſwered to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of faith.</p>

I referre the reader to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98706:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ninth article of the Creede and to the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth diſcourſe of the Praecepts of the Church, where I declare more fully the neceſſity and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſuch a continual Church; where he may ſee how that we could neither know which were the true ſcriptures, nor which were the true ſenſe of them, nor certainely deſtinguish betwixt true and falſe reaſon, nor beleeue any thinge as certaine by faith; but that all order and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in religion were quite deſtroyed, if we had not a continual viſible Church with aſſurance from God of his diuine aſſiſtance with it, and we were bounde to obey it in the deciding of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſys in religion, which by proude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentius men might be raiſed of any point though neuer ſoe cleere. Here now I ſpeake onely of the diuine light and inſpiration vpon which we depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in all points of faith, and I shew that being that this neceſſary light and inſpiration may be counterfeited by our enemy; we muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acknowledge ſome external vniuerſal power vpon earth authorized of God to try and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish the ſeueral ſpirits of all men.

Soe the Archhaeretike that beginneth new doctrines in diſobedience to the whole Church, would haue men to take his word againſt all the world that then is, that he hath the ſpirit of God; and to prooue it he alleageth many reaſons of his owne, but he will not be tryed by any authority; and ſoe his ſpirit being brought to be ſubiect to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reaſon and all things being as you ſee finally reſolued by it, the controuerſy coms in the end to that which in the former title is refuted, and by which he is conuinced, to wit that we are not to be reſolued in matters of faith by our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and priuate reaſons onely; but by the teſtimony of God inwardly in ourharts, and externally as now I shew by the authority of the Church.

               <p>Secondly the true faith hath bene often proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and falſe doctrines confuted by miracles: and theſe miracles haue planely conuinced for the obedience to that Church whoſe faith was ſoe confirmed. Elias prooued by miracles the true faith of the Iſraëlits, and confounded the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Gentils. Soe did Chriſt and his Apoſtles by many miracles prooue the chriſtian faith againſt both Iewes and Gentils. And theſe miracles obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all whom inuincible ignorance excuſed not vnto the obedience of the Church of Chriſt, and shewed planely that the ſpirit of God was to the obedience of that Church; but noe miracle was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98706:35"/>euer wrought to shew that men should obey noe Church; but that they might liue after their owne liking, and beleeue what they would without obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to any authority vpon earth. Neither can there be any miracles wrought for any ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of liuing: for miracles being done in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the true faith oblige others to imbrace that faith which is ſoe confirmed by miracles; and ſoe men come to an vnity of faith, and make a Church, that is to ſay a people vnited together in faith and religion. But if men might for all tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe miracles which they ſee, ſtill follow their owne priuate ſpirits and not vnite themſelues in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that company whoſe faith is ſoe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by miracles; but might diſobey it in matters of faith; then they might diſobey the authority of God, and miracles were to noe purpoſe. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor the very being of true miracles in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith prooueth the being of a Church to which our ſpirits muſt allwais obey. Moreouer if euery man were to be guided by his owne priuate ſpirit without obeying any Church there should be noe neede at all of miracles: for the ſpirit is an inward and miracles are an outward teſtimony of the truth of any thinge to draw others vnto it; but if all were to follow the inward teſtimony of their owne ſpirit without ſubmitting vnto any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power, then were they not to regard the outward teſtimony nor to be drawne by it. And indeede to ſay that euery one is to follow his owne priuate ſpirit without being bounde to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of any external power, is as much as to ſay that euery one hath the true ſpirit of God:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98706:36"/>and then what neede were there of miracles? All which is contrary to the words of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles, and contrary to the examples of the ſcriptures, and to reaſon and experience by which we ſee ſoe many ſpirits of errors and of ſinne in prowde and euill men. Miracles may be and haue bene wrought to prooue the true faith: but ſuch miracles prooue that the ſpirit of God is to the obedience of the Church; therefor the ſpirit of God is to the obedience of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly God hath ordained an orderly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in his diuine worship: and all order includeth ſubordination of inferiours to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour powers, and leaueth vs not to ourſelues alone ſubiect to noe authority in points of religion: and the ſame natural reaſon that bringeth vs to rely vpon the diuine autority in matters of faith telleth vs alſo, that it is a more reaſonable way for God to inſpire vs to the obedience of the Church and to guide it with his ſure and infallible aſſiſtance; then to guide euery man by himſelfe and his owne priuate ſpirit, without being ſubiect to any auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or acknowledging of any ſuperiour: for this were to take away all order, and to bring ſuch a confuſion into the world by making euery man his owne iudge, as would by conſequence deſtroy the world which without order can not ſubſiſt. For if there were not allwais vpon earth ſome power authorized of God to prooue and approoue of the ſpirits of men; what errors would be broched and what villanys committed and mainteined by wicked men vnder pretence of diuine inſpiration? God inſpireth men to an orderly gouernment in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98706:36"/>his diuine worship; therefor the diuine light and inſpiration of faith in allwais to the obedience of the Church. Soe that we may well ſay that faith is a ſupernatural light and gift of God, by which we beleeue and firmely adhaere to the doctrine of the Church. God giueth vs ſupernatural light to enlighten our vnderſtandings, and by his holy inſpiration moueth our wills to ſubmitte ourſelues and to beleeue in all thinges according to the doctrine of the Church; we cooperating with that light and inſpiration of God ſubmitte ourſelues to the obedience of the true Church, and then we haue actually true faith. And whoſoeuer he be that pretendeth himſelfe to haue the ſpirit of God, yet will not ſubmitte himſelfe to any Church but beginneth a new religion contrary to all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches then in the world, or will mainteine a religion which ſoe beganne, certainely that man hath not the true faith, nor is the ſpirit of God in him.</p>
               <p>But he ſayth that he hath prayed to God for his ſpirit, and Chriſt hath ſaid that <hi>our father will giue the good ſpirit to thoſe that aske him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.</note> Many there are that ſatisfy themſelues with this anſwere; and becauſe they ſay their prayers and doe morall good works they will ſtande in diſobedience to the true Church, and mainteine a religion which beganne at ſometime in diſobedience to all the Churches in the world; therefor I will ſay ſomethinge to shew the weakeneſſe of it. I ſay therefor that this man willfully deceiueth himſelfe in that he either prayeth not as he ought to obtaine the diuine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration according to that of S.

                     <hi>Ia.</hi> 4.</note> Iames <hi>you aske and receiue not; becauſe you aske amiſſe;</hi> or if he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98706:37"/>obtained it by his prayer he followed it not. For although it be true that he who prayeth as he ought with a deſire of following of the truth; although he be then in a falſe religion and out of the ſtate of grace obtaineth not withſtanding of congruity the diuine inſpiration to the true faith, and shall come to haue the true faith if he will follow that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but if he beginne a religion in diſobedience to the whole Church of Chriſt or follow a religion which ſoe beganne, in obedience to no knowne Church then extant in all the world; I ſay that either there is ſome defect in his prayer, as there was in the Phariſys prayer who prayed not rightly: or if he prayed rightly, ſoe as that he was then inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God to the obedience of that which is the true Church, that then he followed not the diuine inſpiration: but as that yong man of the ghoſpel who asking of Chriſt what he should doe to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue euerlaſting life, when Chriſt told him <hi>Goe ſell Whatſoeuer thou haſt and giue to the poore, and come follow mee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 10.</note> He followed not the diuine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling but was ſtrucken ſad and went away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Soe doth he and ſoe doe many when God ſufficiently inſpireth them to the Catholike Church: for although God ſpeake to their harts, and haue illuminated their vnderſtandings to thinke at ſometime that the Catholike faith is the true faith; yet they ſleight that good thought; they are ſtrucken ſad to thinke of the perſecution which they hazard in themſelues, children or freinds, endangering their wordly preferment or riches on which they haue ſett their harts, and can not ſoe wel enioy in it: and being dishar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98706:37"/>with theſe thinges they follow not the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God. And although for the preſent their conſcience accuſe them; yet going on in their old way within a while they forgette that euer they were called and will tell you that they ſay their prayers, and that the ſpirit directeth them in the way in which they are. Where as indeede when they rightly conſidered of it the ſpirit of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them a quite contrary way, and would agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne direct them to the ſame way; if they would ſeeke as they ought to be inſpired of God, and obey his inſpiration when he ſpeaketh to their harts.</p>
               <p>In the next place therefor I will shew how the diuine inſpiration to the true Church is to be prayed for. I onely deſire thus much of all thoſe who are out of the Catholike Church; that being as I haue shewed that the true faith, which is by a ſupernatural light and gift of God, is allwais with obedience to the Church, they will reſolue with themſelues to ſeeke vnto God to be inſpired to that Church: And that if he ſpeake to their harts ſoe, as that they come once to thinke that the Catholike Romane Church is the true Church; they take that word of God as a lanterne to their feete and follow it: or els they are all ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in their owne conſciences, and shall finde one day thoſe words to be true which the Holy Ghoſt hath threatened,

And ſoe this point hath onely ſoe farre relation to Catholiks, as that they may gather by it that as hitherto God hath giuen them his holy light and ſpirit to reiect all priuate inuentions both of their owne and of others, to obey the autority of the whole Church and to adhaere to it; ſoe they ought ſtill to doe, and to pray to God that they may allwais doe ſoe and neuer forſake it</p>

This they ſaying, as they needes muſt by conſequence to their new refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; they ought in all reaſon if they will haue any care of their ſoules to be continually feareful and in doubt concerning their faith: and being that the true Church may and did (as they ſay) faile, and was quite decayed out of the world, they ought to pray to God to enlighten them to ſee whether it be not decayed againe as then they ſay it was, and ſtande not neede of a new reformation, as then they ſay it did; and if it doe that he will bring them to the true faith. Or els if they will be out of doubt and free from feares, they muſt beleeue as we doe that the Church could not ſtande neede of any reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all in doctrines of faith, and ſoe to betake themſelues againe to the obedience of it and to reſt ſecure and contented with the Apoſtles Creede <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church,</hi> without troubling themſelues about reforming it. But being that they can neuer be certaine in their faith as long as they hold it lawfull to change their religion by reforming of errors in the Church; they ought to haue often recourſe vnto God to know when they should change their religion, and to what religion they should change. And this by Gods grace I will now shew them how they shall haue
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98706:40"/>recourſe to God for.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98706:40"/>rage againſt him to the extreme horrour of his ſoule: and to thinke truely that in this I aske no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is both according to his owne grounds and alſo reaſonable in it ſelfe. For his predeceſſors hauing forſaken the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of chriſtians which was then vniuerſally profeſſed by that which had the name of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, for a religion which had then noe name nor being in any place of the world, he may with great reaſon feare himſelfe and with much more reaſon forſake his new religion for ſome other that was then extant and eſpecially to that which both is now, and was then the moſt famous of all chriſtendome. But that which I now aske of him is not to change, but onely to haue recourſe to God, and to pray vnto him that if his Church doe erre (as he ſayth that it may and once did) that by his diuine light and inſpiration he will bring him into the true Church. He that were trauailing in a vaſt wildernes vncertaine of his way, and ſaw the darke night comming on, and heard the wild beaſts ſallying out of their dennes roaring and ſeeking for their pray, in what feare and anguish of minde would he be? what would he giue for a guide that could ſett him into à ſafe way free from dangers? much more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the condition of euery man that is out of the Catholike Church: this world is the wildernes in which he wandereth, heauen is his home, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Catholike Church is the onely way to it, death is the night that draweth on, and the infernal ſpirits as wild beaſts ſurrounde him. Poore ſoule thou confeſſeſt thy ſelfe to be in an
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98706:41"/>vncertaine Church which may lead thee to hell, and why doſt thou not tremble for feare and cry vnto God? betake thy ſelfe vnto him, call vpon him, beſeech him earneſtly to guide thee, and that by his holy light and inſpiration he will bring thee to ſee whether thy Church erre or noe, and if it doe to forſake it and to obey the true Church. And this I will shew thee how thou shalt require it of him.</p>
               <p>I ſaid before that the ſpirit of God is denyed to none that rightly aske it. To obtaine then the diuine inſpiration inſpiring vs to the obedience of the true Church, we neede noe more but rightly to aske it. He therefor that beleening in a Church which may erre is reſolued with himſelfe to vſe all poſſible meanes to know whether it erre or noe, and to be inſpired vnto the true Church, let him take a time of purpoſe to thinke of this important buſineſſe and to commende it ſeriouſly to God; and then the firſt thinge which he muſt doe is to prepare himſelfe with a calme and quiet minde and ready promptitude to performe that which God shall inſpire him, firmely purpoſing that nothing in the world shall hinder him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which he shall thinke to be the true way of ſaluation,

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98706:41"/>doe with the Phariſee; but with all the humility and feruour of minde that he can poſſibly ſtirre vp in himſelfe; beſeeching his diuine and infinite goodnes that he will not permitte his ſoule to perish in a falſe religion; but that he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten him to ſee which is the true Church and efficaciouſly inſpire him to the obedience of it. Hauing made his prayer, let him then conſider quietly with himſelfe ſome grounds of religion; as for example the neceſſity of a continual viſible Church declared by holy ſcriptures and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon for the gouernment of the world in the true worship of God; and therefor that muſt be the true Church of Chriſt which hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at all times for the ſaluation of ſoules: and that all thoſe Churches which haue begunne at any time to oppoſe the ſetled Church of Chriſt, which was then in the world are falſe Churches, as being in their beginning guilty of the greeuous ſinne of diſobedience to the continual Church which God hath ordained at all times for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the world in his true worship.

                  </note> Thus Proteſtants themſelues confeſſe that Luther was the beginner of the reformed doctrine which they profeſſe. And thus did all the ſeueral Churches of Chriſtians but the Romane Catholike Church beginne diſobeying of it, and obeying, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues to noe Church then extant in the world. Hauing quietly with himſelfe conſidered ſome ſuch reaſon, noe doubt but God will illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him to thinke and to ſee that this is not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, and inſpire him with pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his will to the obedience of the Romane Catholike Church, out of which all others went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth and had their beginnings in diſobedience to it. And being thus moued and inſpired of God to the obedience of that Church which he then thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his hart to be the true Church, that inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt be followed as the will of God; and preſently without delay he muſt gette himſelfe vnited to that Church. He is therfor firſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his hart with an indifferency and willingnes to doe that which God shall inſpire to him: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to pray earneſtly and humbly to God to inſpire him to the true Church: thirdly with a quiet and calme minde to weigh with himſelfe ſome reaſons and grounds of religion according to his capacity: and laſtly to chooſe and to reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue with himſelfe according to that which God then ſpeaketh to his conſcience and to goe about preſently to performe it. This is a thinge eaſy to be done by them and a thinge which (as I haue shewed) all thoſe that are not Catholiks euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98706:42"/>to their owne grounds ought in all reaſon to doe, if they will haue à care of their ſaluation. And hauing done all this on their parts, they haue done what in nature they could doe; and relying for the reſt vpon God for his helpe, it is then moſt congruous and agreeable to the diuine goodnes to enlighten them and to shew them the truth which they deſire and pray for. And if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they follow it not; it is not for any defect of his aſſiſtance who by reaſons ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing drew them at that time vnto him, and offered them his diuine grace to become actually members of the true Church; but it is of their owne wills and ſtubborne mindes that will not make vſe of thoſe helps and good motions, which were abundantly ſufficient for their conuerſion.</p>
               <p>This is the way which I direct vnto all ſuch tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelers as are out of their way or vncertaine of their way; as all thoſe confeſſe themſelues to be who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in a fallible Church. Let them haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto God, and ſee what he ſpeaketh to their harts, let them open their vnderſtandings to his diuine light, and let them prepare their wills to receiue thoſe inſpirations with which he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to acknowledge his autority in the true Church, and they shall finde comfort in him. By this light and inſpiration of God to obey his Church all are conuerted that are truely conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: in this conſiſteth the ſecurity of all conſtant Catholiks, who not by their owne reaſons, but by the diuine autority and inſpiration are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in all points of faith, and that inſpiration finally tryed not by their owne iudgments, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98706:43"/>approoued of by the continual Church, by which the true faith and worship of God is allwais con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the world; and beleeuing and adhaering vnto that Church, they adhaere vnto the diuine autority, and are grounded vpon a ſure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable rocke.</p>
               <p>I haue ſaid now all that I haue to ſay of faith. I haue shewed in the firſt title that it is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural light and gift of God; and therfor it is moſt vaine and dangerous to ſeeke by natural reaſon into the myſterys of faith euen as though one should thinke to fly, and should ſteppe downe from ſome high precipice, or from the toppe of a houſe. Secondly I haue shewed that the inſpiracion of God to the true faith is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lwais to the obedience of the Church. And laſtly I haue shewed how this diuine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be ſought for, and obtained by thoſe that haue it not. In the following diſcourſes I shall declace the particular myſterys of faith and points of the chriſtian doctrine.</p>
               <p>I wil adde onely a word or two to apply all to the greater honour of God, and your profit, that Chriſt hauing giuen ſentence ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeueth not shall be condemned</hi> and the Apoſtle hauing declared that <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> thoſe that feare the damnation of their ſoules and deſire to pleaſe God wil aboue all things in the world eſteeme of the true Catholike faith, as a pretious iewell and rich treaſure vpon which the loue of God and their ſaluation dependeth, and will not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te themſelues for any hopes or ioyes of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98706:43"/>life, to be depriued of it. It is a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light and gift of God intruſted to thee that art a Catholike, by thy obedience at all times to the continuall Church of Chriſt; and they haue miſerably loſt that treaſure that through pride and peruerſednes haue inuented ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of their owne or mainteined the ſingularitys of others againſt that authority. O wicked pride, O diabolicall peruerſednes! Lucifer was an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeretike, amongſt the Angells by not ſtanding in verity but reſiſting the power of God: And archhaeretiks are Lucifers amongſt men by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending new doctrines againſt the authority of the Church, which is the ſupreme power of God vpon earth. Lucifer beganne the diſorder of the damned and confuſion of hell, where noe order, but eternall horrour dwells: they beginne a diſorder in the Church, by drawing others into contempt of their ſuperiours to mainteine their obſtinacy againſt all authority. How highly doe theſe wretches diſpleaſe God without faith? How deepely are theſe misbeleeuers condemned, charged with the loſſe of ſoe many ſoules, as follow them? This is all that can be ſaid for their comfort, that the diſorder wich they make and confuſion amongſt men, is but a hell vpon earth, out of which they may be freed if they will forſake thoſe ſingularitys which without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they defended, and defende that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which at firſt they forſooke. And this is the comfort which now I would giue them, that they ſeeke againe for the treaſure which they haue loſt. Conſider then the ſtate that you are in, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98706:44"/>greeuouſneſſe of your ſinne, and the loſſe which you ſuſteine, ſoe much to be deplored. It is God which you haue loſt, not a God of ſyluar as that which Michas ranne weeping and wailing for:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg</hi> 18.</note> but it is the foundation of all true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Catholike faith which Ieſus Chriſt preached and eſtablished in his Church, and that Church neuer to be interrupted at any time, nor to ſtande in neede of reformation from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. That Church you muſt ſeeke for, there you shall finde the faith which you deſire, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire indeede the true Catholike faith, and with ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere harts pray to God for it. But you preferre perhaps the temporall goods of this world before the bleſſe of heauen, you feare the loſſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of pleaſures, of dignitys, and perhaps of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe; and you feare nor to offende him in whoſe onely power theſe things are; and beſides all that can deſtroy both ſoule and body into hell. How many are there in the Catholike Church rich enough,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.</note> honorable enough, and healthfull enough, allthough they hazard all this to defende the faith of Chriſt? This adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage we haue of thee that our ſufferings for Chriſts ſake shall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in heauen, and for that which thou ſuffereſt thou shalt haue noe reward. Were it not better allthough with hazard of perſecution to ſaue thy ſoule then to looſe thy ſoule and to be in danger of miſerys here alſo? Chriſt gaue his life for the loue of thee when he needed not, and doſt thou repine to giue thy life for thy owne ſoule? God can giue comfort in the midſt of perſecution, that noe threats of our enemys shall affright vs,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98706:44"/>but that we shall be contented with them, and reioyce in his grace and diuine aſſiſtance which then he wil giue, and which we muſt rely vpon before hand; and then we shall not feare. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ourſelues in that naturall feare: For nature hath noe power in that conflict, but ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace which God will then giue to thoſe that deſire it. But you, ô Catholike ſouldiers that defende this treaſure, how honorable is the cauſe which you defende in it? how powerfull and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is your captaine to defende you? and how rich and liberall to rewarde you in the end? you defende that faith which Chriſt depoſited with his Apoſtles, which they deliuered to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and which deſcended from them by Paſtors to Paſtors and from people to people through all ages and times into your hands. Keepe faithfully the depoſitum thus giuen to you and auoide all thoſe noueltys which men take vp of themſelues, and are not giuen by authority to them.

               <p>The Cros is the cheife inſtrument and weapon with which our Sauiour fought and obtained that glorious victory by which he ſaued vs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for we ought to glory in it and to keepe it in great reuerence. Dauid fighting for the people of God ouercame the Philiſtaean gyant and with a ſword cut of his head; and it pleaſed God that his ſword should afterwards be honored by the people, being carefully lapt vp and kept in the temple as a memoriall of their champions victory. This is very propper to our purpoſe: Dauid may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſt who is our champion, but infinitly more glorious; and therefor more worthy to be honored by vs. But as the ſword was to Dauid ſoe was the Cros in reſpect of Chriſt, the inſtrument of his victory: and if it were the will of God to haue Dauid honored afterwards in his ſword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the honour of it redounded to him, shall not we honour Chriſt in his Cros, and thinke that the honour of the Cros redoundeth vnto Chriſt?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98706:52"/>If ſome euill minded man had entred into the Temple, and taking downe king Dauids ſword from behind the Ephod, had abuſed and broken it; would not this man haue bene iuſt y thought to haue dishonored king Dauid himſelfe? and to haue committed in this a hainous contempt againſt him? yes certainely; becauſe the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which was done would haue bene conceiued as done to his perſon; the ſword being honored onely in relation to him: ſoe the iniurys which are done and honour which is giuen to the Cros redounde vnto Chriſt for whoſe onely ſake we honour it.</p>

               <p>S. Gregory Nazianzen, who flourished a litle after thoſe times, relateth how that the wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Iulian hauing once apoſtatized from the faith of Chriſt, and become an idolatrous Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98706:54"/>amongſt the many vices to which he proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted his ſoule, he gaue himſelfe to the ſtudy of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancy: and being affrighted at the firſt ſight which he had of the deuils, he made on a ſuddaine the ſigne of the Cros, as he had done when he was a chriſtian, and that the euill ſpirits fled then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently away from him. And that to ſatisfy him his maſter magitian told him, that the ſpirits did not feare, but hated the Cros, and that if he would be their Diſciple he muſt leaue it of. And in the ſame place he relateth how that Iulian being on a certaine time with his Southſayers looking into the entrailes of beaſts they found a Cros in them; and inquiring the preſage of it, they told him that by this it was portended that Iulian with all his power should neuer be able to roote out the faith of Chriſt; but that it should laſt for euer.

                  </note> S. Auguſtine came a litle after him, and relateth this miracle wrought by it. There was ſaith he in Carthage a woman by name Innocentia vexed with a Canker in her breaſt, who hauing vſed all the remedys which the phyſitians could praeſcribe, and at laſt meeting with one who told her planely that there was noe remedy for it, but that she muſt haue patience with it and lett it alone; for that according to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates ſuch cankers are worſe for being tampered with. She being then out of hopes by any naturall meanes, betooke herſelfe to the authour of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture who can cure without them. And it pleaſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98706:54"/>God to ſend her a viſion in which she was admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to goe to the Church when baptiſme was adminiſtred, and to procure the firſt that she mette with of the newly baptized chriſtians to make the ſigne of the Cros vpon her breſt, and that ſoe she should be cured. She did ſoe and was reſtored to perfect health. This happened in S. Auguſtines time in the city in which he liued, and himſelfe hauing had the examining of it, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be published.</p>
               <p>We haue then S. Paul and thoſe that liued in the Apoſtles times honoring the Cros as we now doe, and we may ſee by the writings of their ſucceſſors the Saints of the primitiue Church, the power and vertue of the ſigne of the Cros, and what deuotion was then borne to it. He whom all this is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to moue, but shall ſtill oppoſe this bleſſed ſigne sheweth an intollerable obſtinacy, in himſelfe and that he needeth rather ſome meanes to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify his hart, and to moue his will, then any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to conuince his vnderſtanding; and therefor let him haue recourſe vnto God by prayer (as I shewed in the laſt title of the former diſcourſe) that he will enlighten and inſpire him to the truth; for he may deceiue himſelfe, but God can not deceiue him.</p>
               <p>I haue now noe more to ſay of the ſigne of the Cros. You haue ſeene firſt how it is to be made. Secondly what myſterys are contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, to wit the myſterys of the B. Trinity and of the Incarnation. Thirdly what reuerence we ought to beare vnto it. Let vs confeſſe the greatnes of God in the myſtery of the bleſſed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98706:55"/>Trinity, and feare him: let vs acknowledge his loue in the myſtery of the Incarnation, and loue him; and let vs honour that holy ſigne by which thoſe myſterys are ſignifyed. The Cros is the ſword of Chriſt, the glory of chriſtians, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of deuils, our armes and armour againſt all dangers both of body and ſoule. It is (ſaith S. Auguſtine) the chaire in which our maſter ſatte to teach vs.

If thou feeleſt thy ſelfe cold in the loue of God, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in frequenting the Sacraments, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to maſſe &amp;c. and haſt but litle feeling of goodnes nor care of Gods ſeruice in thee, behold Chriſt vpon the Cros, heare him how he calleth vpon thee to ſee him paining vnto death for the loue of thy ſoule. If thou art offended at thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and doſt not forgiue him, behold thy maſter on thee Cros, and heare him not onely forgiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but excuſing and praying for his enemys. If thou feeleſt in thy ſelfe a deſire of praiſe, worldly glory and preferment, behold the ſonne of God in his paſſion become the abiect of men, that a notorius condemned theefe was preferred before him. If by ſickneſſe, ſoares, and other like affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thou art moued to impatience, ſee him in his Paſſion how he gius his bleſſed head, his face, his hands, his feete, and his whole body as a lambe to his enemys to be bounde, to be beaten to be nailed, ſtabbed, cut, and wounded, as they would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98706:55"/>themſelues. See the blood running out of his crowned head by drop after drop, where the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes pierced it, and out of his hands and feete and wounded ſide, not by drops, but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall courſe vntill they were left dry. What did he ſay to thoſe that tormented him, and in his torments vpbraided him with falſe crimes? all that time he anſwered not a word in his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, but with ſilence went on, ſtoode ſtill, or layed downe as they would haue him that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him from place to place, and from one pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to another, he neuer opening his mouth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any eaſe or to intreate for any thing, to teach thee meekeneſſe He defended innocency againſt the power of kings, prieſts, and preſidents, to teach thee fortitude in Gods cauſe. He became naked to teach thee pouerty. He tooke the cuppe of his Paſſion willingly from the Angell, and drunke it vp to the bottome, more then ne needed for the health of mankind; becauſe it was for the honour of God, and his diuine will that he should doe ſoe. Learne thou to reſigne thy will to the will of God, and to be contented in all occaſions as he shall diſpoſe of thee. Finally there is neither writing, nor preaching, nor any words whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that imprinteth ſoe much the loue of God in our harts, nor moueth ſoe efficaciouſly to all vertues, noe not the holy ſcriptures themſelues, nor any remedy ſoe good againſt all kind of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as the meditation of Chriſts Paſſion which is read vnto vs in the ſigne of the Cros.

Thou shalt ſee then this ſigne borne before Chriſt as bright as the ſunne. The Cros shall goe before him, and shall ſpeake with a lowde voice for him, to shew that there was nothing wanting on his part. This ſigne both now and of old doth open the doores that are shutt, is hath extinguished poyſon, it hath tamed wild beaſts, it hath cured the mortall ſtings of ſerpents.

But we are not here to vnderſtande that God the Father without the Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt, made the world; for euery external worke which God doth is done by all the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity: the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, hauing all the ſame vndiuided power, all equally concurring to the making of the world and of euery thinge that is conteined in it. The Father is named firſt and the creation of the world is here parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly attributed to him; becauſe he is the firſt Perſon from whom the Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt eternally proceede.</p>
               <p>God is rightly termed a father to ſignify his power, loue and care ouer vs.
<note place="margin">God a father</note> For as fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne the generation that commeth of them, and gouerne their children and prouide for them: ſoe is God the beginner of this world, he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it with his power, and by his prouidence conſerueth it.

               <p>By <hi>heauen and earth</hi> are vnderſtoode all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures heauenly and earthly, that is both ſpirituall and corporal creatures. And in this the power of God is expreſſed by his external works ſoe, as is ſufficient to deſtinguish him as the ſupreme power,

               <p>God is the moſt perfect of all thinges and therefor a ſpirit; all ouer by his power; and his power is himſelfe. He is not conteined in any place now, noe more then he was before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. He was all wais the ſame power, the ſame goodnes, and thoſe infinite. He euer had a decree to create the world; and that eternall decree he performed in time, making the Angels onely ſpirits, men both ſpiritual in their ſoules and corporall in their bodys, and other creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res as we ſee onely corporall.

This is here but breiſly profeſſed: for the Apoſtles made the Creede but onely as an abbreuiated profeſſion and rule of faith to ground and guide vs in the articles which we were to beleeue: they prooued them in their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98706:60"/>preaching, as neede required: yet that there is a God as in the Creede they ſuppoſe it, ſoe alſo they might doe in their preaching, and needed not to prooue it to Iewes or Gentils, who were then onely in the world, and were neuer likely to deny it. But now in theſe times of ſoe many hereſys, I doe not ſee that any point of faith whatſoeuer is more neceſſary to be prooued. For hereſy as it is a corruption of the true faith, ſoe it corrupteth and deſtroyeth by litle and litle the very hart and roote of all faith, and as it annulleth the authority of the Church, it taketh away the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all certainty, and openeth a gappe to euery mans errors to ſay what he liſteth and for shameleſſe atheiſme to enter in by it. For make it once lawfull to diſobey the Church (which is the onely authority of God externally vpon earth) as all archhaeretiks doe, who beginne their new doctrines with obedience to noe Church then extant in all the world; and then it followeth that euery man without controle may beleeue and teach what he will himſelfe; for there is noe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority vpon earth to controle him, and ſoe he may as well teach atheiſme as hereſy. Secondly <hi>thoſe that are of God are ordained</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) that is to ſay they are with order:
<note place="margin">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98706:61"/>in religion, and by conſequence you take away God, and bring in atheiſme and a worſe diſorder then is in hell. How hateful then is hereſy to God which is oppoſite to all religion? and how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is atheiſme,
<note place="margin">In Collar. Patrum.</note> and neceſſary to be preuented in haeretical times? Caſſianus relateth an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this in which he sheweth by experience that hereſy leadeth into atheiſme. He ſayth that there was a certaine religious man, who beginning firſt of indiſcretion to make compariſons betwixt the Saints, and being reprehended by his ſuperiour for it, he tooke in ſuch euill part his reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he fell to ſay that the Saints were noe better then other men; and when he was reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for his temeratious ſpeech he fled to the ſcriptures, demanding the contrary to be shewed by them: and when the ſcriptures were produced againſt him, he interpreted them after his owne ſenſe and liking: and when the interpretations of holy fathers were alleadged againſt him, he ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all, ſaying that they were men and might erre. Laſtly the authority of the Church guided of God for the orderly gouernment of the world is obiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him: and when he ſaw that he muſt either ſticke to the autority of God gouerning vs by the Church, and deny his owne ſingularity; or ſticke to his owne ſingularity and deny allorder and gouernment of God; he ſtucke like an haeretike to his owne ſingularity and rather then he would ſubmitte vnto the Church he denyed God and fell to atheiſme. The end of this obtinate brute was at laſt to become madde and to dy roaring like a beaſt. Now his laſt propoſition was but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98706:61"/>to the former: for he that in matter of faith will beginne a nouelty by which he ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe from all religions and will obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly mainteine it againſt all Churches, why may he not as well deny that there is a God ſeeing that he hath but his owne opinion for both?</p>
               <p>The ſame experience we haue now a dayes of too many who by long continuance in hereſy and diſobedience to the true Church, ſeeme to haue loſt the very beleefe of God and all feare and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him out of their harts: and in this haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical kingdome it is long ſince come to that, that euery man in religion might in a manner hold what opinious he liked, ſoe that he were not a Romane Catholike, and as an enemy of the Catholike Church would but goe to their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. A neighbour yet liuing not farre from this place mainteined publikly againſt the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the bleſſed Trinity, and the diuinity of our Sauiour, and being many yeares ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for it when he was brought to his tryall he was cleered and by publique authority ſet at liberty to teach his blaſphemys as now he doth to all that will heare and learne them; the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the ſury who was a knight of the beſt ranke in this countrey (of what religion I know not) declaring (as I haue heard) that he would rather take the lines of twenty Papiſts then to haue the blood of one ſuch man vpon him. Tell one of our libertines that he is an atheiſt (which a Romane Catholike preſently would abhorre to heare) moſt English Proteſtants make but a ieſt of it; and many there are who ſeeme
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98706:62"/>as though they would gladly be ſoe indeede, that they might let goe the bridle to all liberty and follow their ſenſuality without reſtraint. They ſeeing the wicked ſometimes to proſper in their liues, and in the end to dy life other men, doe what they can to perſwade themſelues that there is neither heauen nor hell, and to ſay in their harts that there is noe God. This is now the plane caſe of many amongſt vs; and I could rehearſe the prophane ſayings of ſome of our great ones which I haue heard of to this purpoſe many yeares ſince; but they are not worth the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. He that will reade <hi>The Authour of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion.</hi> l. 1. c. 4. may ſee more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly how the doctrine of Proteſtants tendeth to atheiſme, and the vnworthy and atheiſticall ſpeeches of their authors: and in <hi>The Suruey of the new Religion</hi> l. 8. almoſt all ouer, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially c. 3. he may ſee the ſame. This is eaſy to be ſeene in all hereſys, that they beginning allwais in the contempt of the Church, aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues liberty of doctrine, and that liberty of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine bringeth liberty of life: now who doth not ſee the next, and laſt conſequence, which liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of life, and doctrine runneth into.</p>
               <p>It is therefor very neceſſary in theſe times to ſay ſomethinge for haeretiks, in proofe of this firſt article of the Creede, to preſerue it as the hart, roote, and foundation of faith from their corruption, and to let thoſe libertines ſee their extreme folly, that labour to beate out of their harts the feare of God. But Catholiks, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it as a point of the Catholike, and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98706:62"/>faith, neede noe proofe of it, becauſe they haue it as they haue all other points of faith, by the teſtimony of God manifeſting himſelfe to them; who can not deceiue vs as we may doe our ſelues by our owne reaſon. <hi>God is true,</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98706:63"/>together to driue waſpes out of their hiues as the deſtroyers of their nature; and as all kingdomes rize vp in defence of their kings, parents, and fortunes againſt murderers, robbers, and theeues, to exterminate them from the face of the earth; ſoe haue all nations at all times combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt atheiſts to mainteine the diuine power, and to acknowledge God as their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme king and parent and to defende him as their owne liues honours, and fortunes, which by reaſon they ſee cannot be mainteined without order, and cannot be ordered but by the power of God. In ſoe much that all nations of men, and the moſt peruerſed and obſtinate of the Angels, haue allwais acknowledged his diuine power.</p>
                  <p>If the writings of our aunceſtors shall haue any place with vs, (as by reaſon they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we will liue life beaſts, without any correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence of times,) we haue that the prowdeſt of the rebellious ſpirits, as he kept allwais his natural reaſon, ſoe did he allwais keepe his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge, and acknowledgment of God, and neuer ſinned ſoe as to deny his diuine power, or to thinke to be equall with him; for that he knew could neuer be: and euen then when he ſinned, he implyed as much in words, calling God <hi>The moſt high,</hi> as hauing all inferiour to him: he ſinned in deſiring of a higher glory then God had ordained for him, and repining at it, he drew others to be his complices, and to deſire the ſame and to repine with him; and for this he was caſt downe with them into hell. This if
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98706:64"/>we will giue but humane credit to the beſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity we muſt ſoe vnderſtande, as that Lucifer refuted atheiſme euen then when he ſinned, and that God by that firſt ſinne would shew himſelfe to the world.</p>
                  <p>And as amongſt Angels ſoe amongſt men the prowdeſt of all men and moſt prophane were certainely thoſe, who would be worshipped for Gods euen whilſt they liued: yet theſe men neuer fell directly into atheiſme; but rather euen in that hight of pride they implyed an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the diuine power: for they hauing gotten the ſuperiority ouer others, to preſerue it the better, and to begette in their people a greater reuerence vnto them, aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues high titles; and becauſe the title of God is the higheſt of all titles, they would be called ſoe: and that it might not ſeeme vaine, in word and name onely, without ſubſtance, they would be thought to haue ſomethinge more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane in them, and required of their inferiors ſome worship more then the ordinary, which was giuen to men: and ſoe it ſeemeth that Aman would haue had Mardochaeus to haue worshipped him. Yet in this they acknowledged a diuine power; and euen then they worshipped their falſe Gods, as alſo Aman euen then acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a higher power then his owne in the king, whom he worshipped vpon earth.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt libertines that euer were in the doctrine which they taught, was Epicure and his followers; yet neither he nor they euer came to that prophaneneſſe as directly to deny God;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98706:64"/>but onely indirectly and by conſequence, as all wicked men doe in their works, and thoſe that teach falſe doctrines of God doe in words. He and his company perſuaded themſelues that after this life there was noe further felicity for men; but he denyed not but that ſome higher power ordained this preſent felicity of life which we enioy.
<note place="margin">Verbo, Athaus.</note> They profeſſed (ſayeth Prateolus) that there was a diuine power, but they pretended that as God troubled not himſelfe about vs, ſoe he would not haue vs to trouble ourſelues about worshipping of him, but to follow the pleaſures of this world which he had made for vs Cicero ſayth of this libertine that his doctrine was to perſwade men to follow their pleaſures in all thinges, and to trouble themſelues with nothing,

By which it is manifeſt that theſe men were not atheiſts, but that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a diuine power all though they would not trouble themſelues to worship it: which gaue occaſion to the reſt of Philoſophers to call them atheiſts, and to ſet vpon them with arguments as ſuch; becauſe atheiſme was the conſequence of their abſurdity, although they profeſſed it not. That which they profeſſed was the hight of libertiniſme in the purſuite of pleaſures; but it was inferiour to atheiſme which taketh away the firſt principle of reaſon and of all effects.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt all the falſe doctrines which at ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98706:65"/>times haue ſprung vp in the world, and haue bene entertained by ſome nations, or peoples for their owne ends and eaſe, there neuer was any any nation or people that in their higheſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, or loweſt aduerſity for any ends whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but ſtill they acknowledged a diuinity In the firſt beginning of idolatry when the world was diſtracted into ſoe many errors; that euery countrey, city, and family might ſet vp priuate and particular idols to themſelues, as they liked, we doe not reade of any that would deny God and profeſſe atheiſme. They perſecuted thoſe of the true religion who retained the worship of one eternal, and omnipotent God, and would not follow their new idolatry, and worship of many Gods; but ſtill they acknowledged ſome diuine power. And if you deſcende from that firſt ſeparation of men from the diuine worship you shall not finde that in all the time paſt any one nation, prouince or citty in all the world did euer reſolue to profeſſe atheiſme, or did but allow or countenance it. Some few priuate men there haue bene whom auncient authors haue branded with this infamy, as Diagoras, Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, and Theodorus. Yet theſe men if they fell to atheiſme (which alſo may be doubted) could neuer get any footing in the world, but were preſently deteſted for their ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe. Yet I doe not deny but that there haue bene ſome atheiſts in the world, as there is noe wickedneſſe but ſome haue committed it. That which I ſay is that as by natural reaſon we muſt hate vice and by nature abhorre to murder our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98706:65"/>ſoe doe we by nature abhorre the ſinne of atheiſme: and that all nations haue punished it as they doe other vices which are againſt nature. It is noe maruaile that ſome men haue runne willfully into this ſinne, as they haue done into murder and euen to murder themſelues: which notwithſtanding by nature they abhorre, and can expect noe pleaſure, but vtmoſt paine in it. It is indeede a meruaile and moſt admirable, that atheiſme giuing ſoe great liberty to all ſinne, there haue bene in the world ſoe few that haue fallen into it: and by this it is manifeſt that God fights particularly againſt it, and hath giuen by nature to reaſonable creatures to defende his power and goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And perhaps neither thoſe aboue mentioned were guilty of this ſinne. Firſt for that it is not likely that thoſe men were ſoe much peruerted in their mindes and wills as Epicure was in the deſire of liberty, who notwithſtanding as you haue ſeene came short of atheiſme. Secondly I finde by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in S. Iohn Chryſoſtome where he putteth them by name and Socrates together for defending of the ſame doctrine and mainteining of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>Ignoro 'Deos I know not Gods</hi> meaning I know not many Gods in the plurall number,

Now it is well knowne that Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes loſt his life for defending of that propoſition in the ſenſe aboue mentioned of one onely God; and for this they might well be then in danger
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98706:66"/>of their liues.</p>
                  <p>Atheiſme then is a ſinne which cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, but by a generall contradiction to the whole world, and by a violent forcing of nature and conſcience to admitte of all ſinnes, and which hath in it ſelfe the malice of all ſinnes, as allowing of all wickedneſſe whatſoeuer.

So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates dranke poyſon, forced vnto it by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels for defending of one God; yet this was neuer a ſingularity in the world, and euen then was profeſſed by the whole nation of the Iewes, famous in the world: what shall the atheiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue for profeſſing of that, which all nations of the world haue euer abhorred, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting of that which all nations haue euer profeſſed, and was before men profeſſed by Angels, and euen by Lucifer the worſt of deuils? the atheiſt in this goeth beyond Lucifer, and as for the hight of his prophaneneſſe, he deſerueth in a higher nature the damnation of his ſoule, then Lucifer deſerued hell; becauſe he denyeth the firſt principle of nature, and all nations hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by inſtinct of nature ſome religion he will haue none.

                     </note> as that there is a diuine power that made and gouerneth them. Behold then amongſt viſible creatures firſt the heauens, ſee their huge greatnes and capacity, conteining not onely a thouſand and twenty two ſtarres, which aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers haue mentioned, but an innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not diſcerne to reckon, and ſome
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98706:70"/>of them may be thought to be a thouſand times bigger, then the whole globe of the earth: how exceeding great then muſt the capacity of the heauens be to conteine them all? Behold them of a nature incorruptible, ſoe ſolid and ſtrong, that with that mighty violent motion, which ſome of them haue, they neuer breake, nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nor weare away the leaſt haire bredth. See their great brightnes, calmenes, and quietnes, without any noyſe at all in that violence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Looke vpon the elements, the fire next vnto the ſtarry heauens, vnder that the ayre, and then the waters, and the earth: all of them of contrary natures; yet agreeing together in thoſe admirable effects, which we ſee to reſult of their concord, that all ſublunary productions depende not onely of ſome one of them, but of them all.</p>
                  <p>Looke now downe vnto the earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold there the many kindes of liuing and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, and amongſt them all one onely endowed with reaſon, as the Prince of the reſt to order them, and he inueſted with ſuch power and commande, that by nature they feare, and tremble at his voyce. Behold them more in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and firſt thy owne ſoule a ſpirituall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which can moue in an inſtant to the furtheſt part of the earth, or of the heauens; and yet for the preſent is bounde to an earthly body whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will or noe. Conſider then the diſpoſition of thy body, prepared as a ſeate ſitte to receiue it, and with parts conuenient for its operations: and this not by its owne reaſon, for that it hath
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98706:71"/>none. Behold the many diuerſe natures of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures that moue themſelues; ſome flying, ſome walking, ſome creeping, ſome ſwimming, all liuing by the ayre, ſome on the earth, ſome within the earth, ſome in the fire, ſome in the waters: all of them directed by ſome reaſon to loue that which is good for them, and congruous to their nature. Behold thoſe creatures that liue without ſenſe; trees, plants, flowers, and herbes, producing fruits with admirable variety of taſts, ſmells, pleaſant colours, and profitable effects, to delight the ſenſes of higher creatures which are ſenſible, and to ſerue them. And laſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the earth with being onely; yet ſuſteining all liuing thinges in the life which they haue. All theſe haue their limits ſet, their perfections and operations, and are bounde within them whether they will or noe, and did not chooſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but haue onely that which another would giue them. Theſe are the teſtimonys which God hath left of himſelfe, and by theſe teſtimonys we muſt confeſſe the ſupreme power that cauſed all this, and ſett it in that order which we ſee it to haue. And therefor it is natural to man when he looketh vp to the heauens, with gladnes of hart to bleſſe God: and if we haue a litle bird, fly, flower, or any creature though neuer ſoe imperfect in our hands, and conſider attentiuely the parts and compoſition of it, reaſon preſently telleth vs, that it could not make it ſelfe, and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we bleſſe God that made it.</p>
                  <p>Say now according to reaſon, and tell vs who it was that made the heauens, and gaue them that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98706:71"/>huge vaſtneſſe and capacity, more then we can thinke? that brightnes, calmenes, ſolidity, and incorruptibility? who gaue to the elements their mighty power by concorde to produce thoſe great effects? who gaue to man the principality ouer other creatures, and made them by nature to feare and obey him? and who was that ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of mankind, that commanded his ſpirituall and incorruptible ſoule to his corporall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body? what reaſon was it that directed vnreaſonable thinges to that which is good for them? and made thoſe which are vnſenſible to yeeld ſuch pleaſure, and profit to the ſenſes? and who gaue to the earth, that hath not life, power to conſerue the liues of other thinges? He that had power to doe all this, we will confeſſe him to be God, and we will praiſe and bleſſe him. For of themſelues they could not be at all, nor would haue bene with the imperfections which they haue.</p>
                  <p>Here now reaſon is ſufficiently ſatisfyed, and the malice of man conuinced, that shall deny God. For the reaſon of euery man of it ſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conſents (if by malice and liberty it be not forced to the contrary) vnto ſome ſuperiour power, that cauſed theſe thinges. And that power all though we cannot comprehende it, becauſe it is aboue vs, and muſt needes be infinite in perfection: but of what nature ſoeuer that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power be, meaning the ſupreme we ſay <hi>God,</hi> and bleſſe him.</p>
                  <p>All this is breifly formed out of S. Thomas and Ariſtotle after this manner. Whereſoeuer
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98706:72"/>we ſee motion and alteration in any thinge, there we muſt grant a cauſe of that motion and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but we ſee motion and alteration in the productions of creatures, which beginne to be, and before were not; therefor we muſt grant ſome cauſe of that motion, and alteration by which they are produced and come to be. This doth S. Thomas call a demonſtration, and Ariſtotle with the reſt of Philoſophers call it a Metaphyſicall Euidence: that is to ſay an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is not onely deduced by Phyſical principles of nature; but that the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth repugnance in it ſelfe: and that it is the firſt euident certainty, from which all natural euidences are deduced. And to contradict it is either to ſay that all the world came by chance; or els to runne from cauſe to cauſe without end into inſinites, which in ſubſtance commeth to be the ſame, noe cauſe at all being aſſigned. Firſt the alterations which we ſee can not come by chance: for there can be noe alteration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe. Neither are the alterations which we call chances ſoe called, becauſe they are without a cauſe, but becauſe they are vncertaine in their cauſes, as might be manifeſted by examples, which were too long for this place. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is not to the purpoſe: for reaſon is now required, and reaſon requires reaſon, and is not ſatisfyed with chance; for that is to giue noe reaſon at all. To ſay that the productions of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures procede from infinite cauſes is a greater abſurdity, and indeede in termes an infinite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, as making an infinite collection of men,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98706:72"/>and ſoe of other creatures, ſucceeding one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other without beginning, yet euety man of this infinite collection to haue had a beginning and time to be conceiued and diſpoſed in.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I would keepe within the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citys of all, I will omitte much which might here be ſaid, and ſay noe more but this, that if we should ſet vp ſuch a ſucceſſion of infinite effects from infinite cauſes, for euer producing one another we should neuer come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any thinge, nor aſſigne the cauſe of any thinge, but ſtill runne into infinites. And by this very reaſon did Ariſtotle although a Pagan acknowledge one ſupreme, omnipotent, and eternall cauſe of all thinges, and all to haue proceeded from him, to auoide the abſurdity, and repugnance of infinite cauſes, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſaw would follow. Neither can there be any ſatisfaction to reaſon for this admirable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and harmony which creatures make, but to come to one ſupreme power, and higheſt reaſon which gaue vnto creatures their power and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in thoſe limits, and order, which we ſee them to haue, that Aſtronomers can fore tell to an inſtant the courſes of the ſunne, moone, and other planets, and their certaine ecclypſes many dayes before they come to paſſe; and that prieſts and exorciſts haue power ouer the deuils to commande them in poſſeſſed perſons to thoſe ſtrange effects, which we ſee. None of which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages would prophane men beleeue, if they were not ſeene. Therefor we ſeeing ſuch an order in natural thinges, and alſo ſupernatural effects
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98706:73"/>aboue nature we muſt of neceſſity grant a ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me cauſe of nature, and ſupernaturall power that diſpenſeth with it, when and as it pleaſeth him: and that this power being that it limited all is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by none; but is without limits, one eternal and omnipotent God, in whom and of whom all thinges are. And ſoe the queſtion is anſwered, and reaſon is ſatisfyed, hauing all that it deſireth, which is the reſt of that motion, and cauſe of that alteration which we ſee in creatures.</p>
                  <p>Thus by the light of reaſon God sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to vs and calleth vs to ſerue him: and if any man shall for harden his hart by ſinne, and the loue of liberty, as not to be moued with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of all nations, with that feare and feeling which he hath of God, and with theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and eaſy reaſons, he were rather to be looked vpon as a monſter ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, is rather to be diſwaded from vice by the reaſon and natural auerſion which he hath from it, then to be delt with by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefor I ſay noe more to ſuch a man but this onely word; let him fly vice and follow a vertuous, and orderly life, as reaſon dictateth that he should; and then noe doubt but within a while he shall both ſee the power of God in all creatures, and alſo shall obſerue his diuine prouidence, and goodnes by many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in particular to himſelfe. For there is nothing that dulleth reaſon and confoundeth it ſoe much in vs, as the much following of our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98706:73"/>owne wills, and long continuance in ſinne without repentance; nor is there any thinge which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our vnderſtandings ſoe much to reaſon, as the following of reaſon in order, and goodnes of life.</p>
                  <p>You shall ſee now in a word or two how the maſter of Philoſophers hath diſcourſed of God by naturall reaſon onely. He ſeeing that ſome cauſe by reaſon should be aſſigned of creatures, and not to leaue them to chance, and perceiuing the abſurdity and contradiction of running into infinite cauſes, came to ſetle himſelfe in one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and omnipotent God, as the firſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme cauſe of all thinges, and ſpoke very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably and with great reuerence of him, giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſuch titles as might declare his ſoueraigne power and eminent perfections aboue all, as hauing all thinges depending of him.

By the firſt atheiſme, and by the ſecond paganiſme is reiected. And the firſt being allready ſoe fully declared, it will not be needfull to inſiſt much vpon the ſecond point, it being a verity which the wiſeſt of pagane Philoſophers haue by reaſon diſcouered, who haue confeſſed one ſupreme and firſt cauſe of all effects. And therefor S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine reporteth of Seneca the Philoſopher,

                  <p>This is ſufficient by natural reaſon of this verity.

               </p>
               <p>ALL this we ſay in the Creede, when we profeſſe our beleefe in leſus Chriſt the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne of God, borne of the Virgin Mary Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed for our Redemption, that he shall come to iudge vs all, and that there is life euerlaſting, to wit to thoſe that are iuſt through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt. Thus this anſwere is contained in the Creede. In the which we hauing firſt profeſſed our faith in God, as he created vs, we profeſſe him now in another miſtery, to wit as he was incarnated to redeeme vs: a myſtery which we can neuer acknowledge with ſufficient gratitude. For the vnderſtanding of which we may reflect vpon our former condition and the miſery out of which we are freed by it. Man was in paradiſe in a happy ſtate of ſpirituall and corporall delights, his ſoule was in grace and fauour with God, and his body had then the gift of immortality, that without dying it should enioy thoſe pleaſures for a time, and afterwards the glory of heauen for euer. He was warned onely of one thinge, and that was to forbeare one fruit of Paradiſe; which God to keepe him in obedience, and due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98706:76"/>had forbidden him to eate of.

For in what day ſoeuer thou shalt eate of it, thou shalt dy the death.</hi> To wit the death of body and ſoule. Man forbore not, but eate of that forbidden tree, and as ſoone as he eate of it his ſoule died inſtantly, and his body from that time beganne to dy. But the death of our ſoules being indeede our true and greateſt miſery, God was moued with pitty towards them, and of his infinit mercy he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to reuiue them againe to his diuine grace and fauour. For this he ſent his onely ſonne to be incarnated, that is to take the flesh, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man vpon him; that in that nature he might make ſatisfaction for the firſt ſinne which man had committed, and for the ſinnes of all men occaſioned by it. And ſatisfaction being made by him, the wrath of God might then ceaſe againſt vs, and we becomming his beloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and freinds, might ſerue him worthily, and obtaine the bliſſe of heauen, which before we had loſt.</p>
               <p>All the Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red equally to the effecting of this myſtery, as hauing all one and the ſame vndiuided power; but the worke was effected in the Sonne onely, the ſecond Perſon who was incarnated. Authors commonly declare this by the ſimilitude of two helping another to put on a garment. They all three concurre to the veſting of one of them, and one of them onely is veſted with the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98706:76"/>garment. The garment in this myſtery is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, with which the Sonne of God onely was veſted; but the Father and Holy Ghoſt both concurred with him to the putting on of that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Sonne of God being ſoe veſted, that in Chriſt our nature was really vnited to him, we ſay truely that Chriſt our Sauiour is true man, as conſiſting of two deſtinct natures, diuine and humane. According to his diuine nature he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded eternally from God the Father; according to his humane nature he proceeded in time from the bleſſed Virgin his mother; and according to that nature he made ſatisfaction ſufficient in it ſelfe for the ſinnes of all men that euer were, or shall be; and therefor we call him out Sauiour and Redeemer; becauſe all whoſoeuer haue bene, or can be ſaued, are ſaued by the merits of his Paſſion. He is our Iudge, and in the latter day shall iudge vs. He is our Glorifyer, for that by his merits our good works become meritorious, and purchaſing of glory.

It was then noe meruaile that with Gods grace he would defende him till death. Thus did the Apoſtles profeſſe of him; and this profeſſion they made good by many miracles, which the enemys of chriſtianity haue written of and confeſſed. This the poſterity of the Apoſtles haue allwais profeſſed in former ages and haue ſtretched forth their hands and feete vpon racks, and with cheerfull mindes haue yeelded their bodys into the hands of torturers,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98706:79"/>to vſe their owne wills, and to fullfill their deſires vpon them by what torments they would; rather then to forſake the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: and thouſands of thouſands of faithfull chriſtians, gathered together in the Catholike Church, are now ready with them in the ſame manner to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it. But we will honour Chriſt, and comfort good chriſtians, by declaring the teſtimonys which God hath giuen of him.</p>
                  <p>We haue of Chriſt two kindes of diuine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys. Firſt by diuine ſcriptures, and ſecondly by his miraculous works. We will heare firſt what the ſcriptures teſtify of him. When the myſtery of the Incarnation was fullfilled, and Chriſt came into the world, there were then in all the world but two onely religions, or diuine worships profeſſed: to wit the religion of the Iewes, who worshipped one eternall, and omnipotent God: and the religion of the Gentils or Pagans adoring many Gods. And the worship of one God being in the firſt article ſetled for true, and the worship of many Gods reiected by the Apoſtles for falſe, it followeth that the people of the Iewes were then the people of God, whom he had choſen to be truely honored amongſt. Secondly it followeth that the Iewes hauing then the true faith and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship, whatſoeuer they then beleeued was true, and that they then beleeuing in Chriſt as to come he was then indeede to come; and whatſoeuer they beleeued of him then as future, the ſame we are to beleeue of him as paſt; and whatſoeuer the ſcriptures receiued by them (which are the old Teſtament (haue declared of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98706:79"/>him, that is allwais to be beleeued as of diuine authority, and as ſpoken by the word of God, who dictated thoſe ſcriptures, for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world in the true worship of him.</p>
                  <p>Now the holy ſcriptures of the old teſtament deliuer ſoe planely the comming of a Meſſias, or (which is all one) a Chriſt to redeeme the world, that all whoſoeuer receiue thoſe ſcriptures doe ſtill confeſſe it. For it is the maine butte, and prime ſcope of the old Teſtament, to shew that Chriſt was promiſed from the beginning to the Patriarks, and reuealed from time to time to the Prophets, that the world might expect him then to come; as it is the butte and ſcope of the new Teſtament to declare him to the world to be allready come. And as the new Teſtament deſcribeth all ouer the ioy of the faithfull in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying him; ſoe did the old teſtament comfort the faithfull then with the expectation and hopes of him. Firſt his comming was ſignifyed euen at firſt in paradiſe in terrour to the ſerpent who had cauſed our ſinne, when our Lord threatening him with an enemy that should come againſt him ſaid, <hi>I will put enmitys bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>and thy ſeede and the ſeede of her: she shall bruize thy head in peeces, and thou shalt ly in waite of her heele.</hi> Chriſt was by this myſteriouſly denoted, God then declaring that the enmity of mankind with the ſerpent was to be eſpecially betwixt him and the ſeede of a woman: by which it is ſignifyed that Chriſt the Redeemer of the world and the ſerpents greateſt enemy should be particularly the ſeede of a woman; and is not there ſaid to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98706:80"/>of the ſeede of a man; becauſe he was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and borne of a Virgin mother, without the helpe of man. And this was the prerogatiue of the Sauiour of the world that the ſinne of mankind being firſt occaſioned by a woman; he that was to be the death and deſtruction of ſinne should be by the power of God of womans ſeede onely, without man. The ſame was deliuered by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Patriarks, and Prophets afterwards; and they did not onely declare it to poſterity; but alſo deſcribed the manner of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.

After ſome yeares he was made bishop of Burgos in Spaine, and became an eminent prelate in the Church of God, and wrote his commentarys vpon Lyra,

And it is to be obſerued that this Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daike tranſlation is eſteemed of by the Iewes for the moſt authenticall tranſlation which they haue; in ſoe much that they place it with their ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in another columne ouer againſt the text, that they may haue it ready at hand for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

The ſea and the earth were then moued, when all the ſubiects of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Empire repaired to their natiue places, to haue their names enrolled; as though of purpoſe that the B. Virgin Mary might goe from Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to Bethleem, the place where the Sauiour of the world, according to the Prophets, was to be borne. Which motion being generall in all the vaſt dominions of the Romanes, was moſt remarkeable and ſoe great and ſtrange a motion both by ſcaand land, as vntill then the world had neuer ſeene nor could ſee; and therefor moſt worthy to be noted.

                  <p>He now that should thinke to ſatisfy all theſe ſcriptures concerning the time, circumſtances, and ſignes, by which they haue foreshewed the comming of the Meſſias, by ſaying that he is all-ready come, and came about that time in which our B.

Nor did he offer to reſiſt or let others to doe it for him; allthough he shewed planely that by many meanes he could haue defended himſelfe. With theſe and the like vertues he planted firſt his ghoſpell. He confirmed it alſo with many miracles which he wrought, giuing health to the ſicke, ſight to the blinde, hearing to the deafe, ſpeech to the dumbe, and reſtoring the dead to life againe. And he confirmed the miracles of his life by his glorious reſurrection when he was dead? Who euer heard the like to this? Chriſt confirmed his doctrine with a moſt eminent ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of life; he confirmed againe the verity of his doctrine, and fanctity of life by as plane mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as any can be; and to confirme all this, he promiſed that within three dayes after his death, he would raiſe himſelfe againe to life, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it All this our bleſſed Sauiour did, to draw vs to him, and eſpecially to the lewes to bring them to receiue his doctrine, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

We reade of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe wicked men, who by falſe deluſions haue gone about to prooue their errors; but the holieſt of men that euer were neuer shewed the like ſanctity, nor wrought ſuch miracles as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour wrought, nor concluded them with their reſurrection from the dead. This would the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of God particularly reſerue to himſelfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that ghoſpell which he was to preach, and to make manifeſt his diuine, and ſoueraigne power, that he was the authour of life and death. Mahomet indeede had many wayes by falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures to delude his ſouldiers; but being once dead his power was at an end. In his life time he shewed himſelfe an Anti Chriſt to Chriſt, prowdly extolling himſelfe aboue the Sonne of God, and promiſed to his followers that he would rize agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne from the dead; but as I ſay he being once dead, his power was at an end, and his promiſe vanished away with him. His promiſe was to rize againe to the world eight hundred yeares after his death; and although he tooke ſoe long a ſpace for it; yet now that ſpace is runne, and eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares being paſt long ſince, Mahomet is ſtill as dead as he was, and we haue noe newſe of his riſing againe. The whole world was witneſſe of our Sauiour Chriſt his death, thouſands of people ſaw what he ſuffered, and beheld his death vpon the Cros; and the third day after he roze againe to life, and made his enemys the witneſſes of his reſurrection.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98706:87"/>of our bleſſed Sauiours reſurrection: for it is a moſt material, and maine ground of the Apoſtles in their preaching, for the foundation of the chriſtian faith and conuerſion of Inſidels; as may be ſeene all ouer in their acts and Epiſtles. S.

Firſt Chriſt would ſoe notify the myſtery of his reſurrection in his life time, as that his very enemys might ſtande in expectation afterwards to ſee the performance of it; and that by it he might not onely encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his diſciples and reinforce, them who as faint harted ſouldiers had forſaken him in his Paſſion; but alſo that it might ſerue as a teſtimony to the world of the verity of his doctrine, and that his ſufferings were voluntarily vndergone, and of his owne good will; that ſoe the ſcandall of the Cros might be taken away, and all ſeeing his power might beleeue in him. And therefor he ſpoke of it, and promiſed it firſt whilſt he liued, and would in his Paſſion be publikely accuſed of it, vntill he had made it ſoe knowne, that the Prieſts of the Iewes and Phariſees hearing ofit, might labour all they could to hinder it, and that all their labour might appeare to be in vaine.

For an Angell of our Lord deſcended from heauen: and comming rolled backe the ſtone and ſate vpon it: and his countenace was as lightening: and his garment white as ſnowand for feare of him the watchmen were affrighted and became as dead. And the Angell anſwering ſaid to the women feare not you. For I know that you ſeeke Ieſus that was Crucifyed. He is not here for he is rizen as he ſaid. Come and ſee the place where our Lord was laid.</hi> All theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the watchmen were made witneſſes of, and teſtifyed them to the cheife Prieſts; who conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98706:88"/>together gaue them a great ſumme of money, to ſay that his diſciples had come by night, and had ſtolne him away when they were a ſleepe: and promiſed to them that if the Preſident should come to heare of it, they would perſwade him and ſecure them. Who notwithſtanding would not be perſwaded by them; but taking the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular examination of it from the watchmen themſelues, informed Caeſar of the truth of it; and by his information, and other motiues the Emperour was ſoe moued in affection towards Chriſt that he propoſed in the ſenate for diuine honour to be giuen to him by the Romanes: and being offended that he obtained it not, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected thoſe that were deuoted vnto him, and commanded vnder paine of death that none should hinder their deuotion.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt would not leaue his reſurrection with theſe onely, although ſufficient teſtimonys of the good women, and euill watchmen; but would appeare aliue vnto many more, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained forty dayes after it vpon earth, that by many apparitions, in which he often shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he might giue ſufficient proofe of it.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98706:89"/>ſaid of the miracles of Chriſt: to wit that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his doctrine with miracles, and his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous life by his reſurrection from the dead: the Prophets being inſpired to foretell theſe thinges of him.</p>
                  <p>And as Chriſt himſelfe firſt founded the ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of our beleefe in the fanctity of his owne life and miracles;
<note place="margin">The Apostles preaching.</note> ſoe alſo would he haue the ſame faith to be propagated afterwards by the ſanctity and miracles of his Apoſtles. Firſt their holines of life was admitable euen to their enemys. They were contented with shame, pouerty, hungar, cold, heate, impriſonment, banishment, whipps, and all kind of diſgraces, and crueltys, that they might honour Chriſt and enioy him. And ſoe willingly did they ſuffer without euer repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them of that which they had done for Chriſts ſake; that after perſecution they ſtill beganne againe to preach him; carrying his ghoſpell from place to place, and proclaiming it amongſt all ſorts of people, not fearing the barbarousneſſe of any, but condemning all danger and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inceſſantly, reiovced to ſuffer for him. They mainteined the ghoſpell of Leſus Chriſt with ſuch reaſons, force of ſpirit, and miracles, that being themſelues vnlearned, they confounded the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edeſt of the world. All were aſtonished at the hearing of them, the fame of their preaching ringing in all places. They confounded the Iewes, ſilenced the oracles of the idols; and with in a few yeares they filled the world with a number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe number of conſtant chriſtians. And this they did not by force of armes, making of ſeditions,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98706:90"/>or raiſing of partys to defende their cauſe, or to increaſe their number; but with humility and patience. Thus did the faith of Chriſt beginne in the vertue and power of God; and not as ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Turciſme, by the power and commande of the ſword, forcing of people to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. It beganne in litlenes, pouerty, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and patience, and increaſed as a grane of muſtarde ſeede into a goodly tree: hauing noe Princes or potentates of the earth to protect or to countenance it, noe men of learning, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or humane pollicy, to draw others vnto it; but of ſuch learning and eloquence as God infuſed into them. God ſpoke in their mouths, and with their hands: and God ſoe ſpeaking the prowde of the world came downe to their doctrine and became humble chriſtians, the rich of the world contemned riches, the followers of vice beganne to loue vertue, and a happy change was ſeene in the world by them. They had to conteſt with Princes, Iudges, Prieſts, Magiſtrates, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, artificers, and all ſorts of people, who as their enemys mainteined their auncient rites and Priuileges againſt them Yet theſe poore and ignorant men kept ſtill the chriſtian faith on foote, and maugre all the power which their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys had, the more they oppoſed it, the more God increaſed it, and the number of the faithfull was daily augmented: that their enemys of all ranks and manner of callings in the end were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ioyne with them, and to hazard their titles, dignitys and profits, and to forſake their owne wills, and liues to obey Chriſt. This was
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98706:90"/>moſt miraculous; euen as much as the miracles which they wrought, and as planely teſtifyeth the power of God to haue brought theſe thinges to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>After the Apoſtles the ſame faith of Chriſt was ſtill continued by others, whom God raiſed as Apoſtles to ſucceede them; and to whom he gaue the ſame ſpirit with ſanctity of life, and power of miracles to defende it. And is at this day profeſſed and defended by miſſions of Prieſts and religious men, who goe as Apoſtles to preach the faith of Chriſt (as I haue ſeene in Spaine eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeare) for the moſt part to be ſent vnto the ſtrange and rude people of the Indias for their conuerſion) and by ſoe many miracles make good that which they preach, that it were a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to queſtion all thoſe thinges which God hath wrought by them.</p>
                  <p>And euen here amongſt vs vnworthy we ſee by continuall experiences the power which Chriſt promiſed to his Apoſtles of caſting forth deuils,
<note place="margin">Exorciſmes.</note> to be practiſedby chriſtian Prieſts with good ſucceſſe; the powers of hell tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling at the name of Chriſt, are forced whether they will or noe to yeeld poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion when they areco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by it. And to attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te this vnto art magicke by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deuils ouer the leſſe, is that deſperate refuge which the Iewes vſed againſt Chriſt himſelfe,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</note> ſaying that <hi>in Beelzebub Prince of the deuils</hi> he did caſt forth deuils; and which was commonly obiected againſt the Apoſtles by their enemys, and can not be true. Firſt for that the exorciſmes of the Church are not done againſt the leſſer deuils onely, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98706:91"/>with the greateſt oppoſition, hatred, and deſpite that poſſible may be againſt the greateſt and all the deuils of hell; ouer whom there is none but God, that hath ſupernaturall power. Secondly the kingdome of the deuils is not ſoe diuided, as that any of them should doe good or hinder euill except they be forced vnto it by the power of God; yet by chriſtian exorciſts they are often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to many thinges amongſt Infidels to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of infidelity and hereſy, and amongſt chriſtians of euill life to the hinderance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſinne: which the deuills with all their power would mainteine. Thirdly if we might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that which is done to the extirpation of infidelity, hereſy, and confuſion of ſinne, or for ſome good end, to any other but the power of God; we should neuer acknowledge, nor could euer deſtinguish the power of God at any time to be exercized ouer the deuils; although we ſaw them neuer ſoe much forced, and neuer ſoe good effects to proceede of it; but might attribute goodnes to the authour of euill. And this was that manifeſt conuincing argument with which our Sauiour anſwered to the Phariſys, when they made this very obiection againſt him <hi>If I</hi> in Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub caſt <hi>forth deuils,</hi>

                  <p>We haue then for the comfort of chriſtians chriſtianity demonſtrated by the holy ſcriptures of the old teſtament and the miracles of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles, and of the continually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and now being Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That which he taught and confirmed by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98706:91"/>was, that he was the Sonne of God, the authour of life, the promiſed Meſſias and Sauiour of the world. This the Apoſtles preached after him: and this we now preach in the Catholike Church,

For this is a rule without exception in the myſtery of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, that all the externall works of God, to wit thoſe which he doth in reſpect of creatures, are done indiuiſibly by all the Perſons of the B. Trinity; becauſe their power is all one indiuiſible power in them: and ſoe the Conception of our Sauiour was done by the ſame power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt. And to ſay here that Chriſt was conceiued by the Holy Ghoſt is the ſame as to ſay, that his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98706:92"/>was by the power, and ſpeciall gift of God, after a ſupernaturall and not after a natural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is here attributed particularly to the holy ghoſt by reaſon of the great loue and bounty of God which he shewed in it. For although all the diuine perfections be equally commune to all the Perſons of the B. Trinity; yet ſome certaine titles or attributes there are, which are vſed as propper and particular to them ſeuerally. Soe we attribute power to God the Father; becauſe the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt proceede from him. We attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute wiſdome to the Sonne; becauſe he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Father by way of vnderſtanding. We attribute goodneſſe, loue, bounty, and the like to the Holy Ghoſt; becauſe the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne by the operation of the will, which loueth nothing but that which either is good, or at leaſt is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then as good. And ſoe thoſe works of God in which his power is moſt manifeſted are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Father: thoſe which declare moſt his wiſdome are attributed to the Sonne: and thoſe which shew moſt his goodnes, loue, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the like, are attributed to the Holy Ghoſt. Neither was it an inuention of men by theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and attributes to deſtinguish the diuine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but it was an inuention of God himſelfe. The Apoſtles were inſpired to attribute power particularly to the Father; ſaying I beleeue in God the Father <hi>Almighty.</hi> S. Iohn was inſpired to attribute wisdome to the Sonne calling him the <hi>Word</hi> of God which was from the beginning. And Chriſt himſelfe attributed goodnes in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98706:93"/>to the Holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.</note> ſaying <hi>your father from heauen will giue the Good Spirit to thoſe that aske him.</hi> Soe although all the diuine perſons be equall in power, wiſdome, goodnes, and in all perfections the ſame, according to S. Iohn <hi>Theſe three be one,</hi> and ſoe all of them concurre equally to the Conception of Chriſt; yet here it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted particularly to the Holy Ghoſt; becauſe the loue of God is ſoe eminently manifeſted in it. For the ſame reaſon we paint the Father as an auncient man; becauſe the Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt proceede from him: we paint the Sonne in humane nature, an intellectuall creature, becauſe his proceſſion is by way of vnderſtanding: we paint the Holy Ghoſt as a done; becauſe the done is a bird that sheweth moſt loue; and loue (as I haue ſaid) is the property of the Holy Ghoſt. Neither can it be diſpleaſing to God that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe him by theſe corporal shapes and ſpecies of viſible things, which are naturall and neceſſary for our vnderſtandings.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98706:94"/>in one perſon the vnion of two natures, and Chriſt who was the eternall ſonne of God, was alſo the ſonne of man, as he proceeded of the Virgin Mary: both natures in that admirable coniunction keeping their perfections, that as S. Leo ſaith <hi>the glorification neither conſuming the inferiour, nor the aſſumption deminishing from the ſuperiour.</hi> This is a myſtery incomprehenſible by vs; and therefor the omnipotency of God was propounded by the Angell to our bleſſed lady as to be conſidered particularly in this worke,

                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.</note> when he ſaid <hi>the Holy Ghoſt shall come vpon thee, and the power of the moſt high shall ouer shaddow thee.</hi> For as the loue and goodnes of God towards vs appeareth here moſt illuſtrious; ſoe was it moſt congruous, that his power should appeare aboue our vnderſtandings, moſt miraculous.</p>
               <p>The conception of Chriſt ſurpaſſed all ordinary conceptions not onely in that he was conceiued of a Virgin mother; but alſo in the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. For where as the ſpace of ſome dayes is required for the framing of our bodys, and to diſpoſe them for our ſoules; the ſacred body and ſoule of our Lord were both vnited together in the firſt inſtant of his conception, and the diuine nature vnto them: by which his humanity was enriched with diuine gifts, and was in eminency of dignity and ſanctity aboue all: all others being by adoption onely, and Chriſt by nature the ſonne of God. This is not vnderſtoode by vs, but beleeued; yet it was as eaſy to God that by his high power a Virgin should conceiue, and bring forth without the concurſe of man; as it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98706:94"/>was for the rodd of Aaron to conceiue nourishing moyſture, and to putt forth budds, leaues, flowers,

And it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede as eaſy to God to make a Virgin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue as the bleſſed Virgin did of her owne nature onely with out the helpe of man, and to frame a body in an inſtant, as our bleſſed Sauiours was, as it was for him to make all other women to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with the helpe of man, and to frame the body by litle and litle with fitte diſpoſitions for the ſoule: which he could haue ordained other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but would not; becauſe he would haue the conception of Chriſt to be aboue all moſt pure and miraculous.</p>
               <p>And as the conception of Chriſt was moſt miſterious; ſoe was it fitting that his birth alſo should be: that she who had conceiued with the priuilege of her Virginity free from corruption, should bring him forth in her deliuery free from paine, and other myſerys which other women are then ſubiect vnto. And that as the ioy with which she conceiued him was not corporal, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and ſpiritual; ſoe that his birth should be alſo full of ioy and heauenly conſolation to her. For if God would ſend his Angell to the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards to comfort their harts and to fill them with ioy for the birth of our Sauiour; how great may we thinke the ioy of the B. Virgin then to haue bene, who was ſoe ſingularly choſen of God to be his mother? We can not but with reuerence thinke of thoſe conſolations, which she had in his birth. He came from her ſacred wombe as the beames
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98706:95"/>of the ſunne pierce through cleare cryſtal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting it; and as the ſame ſacred body of our Lord paſſed through the ſepulcher in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection without breaking it, ſoe did he paſſe out of his mothers wombe without any violence done to her.</p>
               <p>We ought very much to reioyce in the birth of Chriſt for the reaſon which the Angell gius, <hi>becauſe this day is borne to you a Sauiour.</hi> What greater ioy can priſoners, and condemned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue, then in one that will ſaue them. We haue then great reaſon to reioyce in that ioy which the Angell brought, and to celebrate euery yeare that ſacred day. And yet ſoe great is the malice of hereſy, ſoe dishonorable to God, and peruerting the mindes of men, that ſome in this kingdome, who call themſelues chriſtians, dare venture to worke on Chriſtmas day, refuſing to giue that honour, which all chriſtians haue ſoe long giuen to the birth day of Chriſt. We reade in holy ſcriptures that kings in auncient times kept feſtiuall the yearely day of their birthes: ſoe Pharao Gen. 40. Antiochus. Mach. 2.6. and Herod Mat. 14. and can the birth day of any king with iuſtice be obſerued, and not the birth day of Chriſt the king and Sauiour of the world? If ſome courtyer of Pharao had refuſed to keepe the feaſt of his birth day, oppoſing the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which the reſt did obſerue; would not he with reaſon haue iudged it as an affront, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished it as a dishonour done to him? How dare then any chriſtian be ſoe bold, and prophane, as not to keepe the ſolemnity of Chriſts birth,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98706:95"/>knowing that one day he shall iudge him for it? It is true authors differ in aſſigning the day on which he was borne. But what then? shall we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for keepe noe day at all in honour of it? or shal any one shew himſelfe ſoe ſingular and prowde, as vpon his owne ſenſe and authority to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the whole Church of Chriſt? We know not for certaine the time in which the ſcriptures were written, nor the authors that wrote them all; shall we therefor reiect them as ſome haeretiks haue done, and haue noe ſcriptures at all? we know not iuſt the time in which the Sundays Sabaoth was firſt begunne to be kept; shall any one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for refuſe to obſerue it? but if the Church could change the Sabaoth from the ſeuenth day, on which God had inſtituted it, to the eight day; and could binde all ſoe to obſerue it, although it were not the day on which God reſted from the creation of the world; shall not the Church binde all to obſerue a day which she determineth in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſts birth? although perhaps he was not borne iuſt on that day?

That face of life whoſe beauty the Angells deſire to behold, is left pale and dead without comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and beauty. The horrible paine which Chriſt ſuffered in his Paſſion is not to be apprehended by vs; but was without doubt ſoe great in it ſelfe, that the apprehenſion of it in him had bene ſufficient to haue bereaued him of life, if he had not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported nature by ſupernaturall meanes; as he did in that agony which he ſuffered in the garden by the apprehenſion onely of his future Paſſion,

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98706:97"/>torments of his Paſſion, which he foreſaw, and according to the inferiour part of his ſoule, he deſired and prayed to be freed from, although they were woluntary to him.</p>
               <p>For the vnderſtanding of which we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande two powers in the ſoule of man commonly called the Superiour, and Inferiour part, or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoule. The ſuperiour power is in reſpect of its higher operations of reaſon and will, which it hath equall with the Angels. The inferiour part or portion of the ſoule is the inſeriour powerwhich it hath, as it is ſenſitiue, cauſing vs to feele by our ſenſes, as inferiour creatures doe. According to the ſuperiour of the ſoule, the Paſſion of Chriſt was nothing ſorrowfull to him, as not being contrary to his reaſon and will; but it was moſt voluntary nay ioyfull to him: he went as a gyant to runne that race, and was ſtraightened vntill he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the baptiſme of his Paſſion. According to the inferiour power of the ſoule, as it is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he could not but feele paine, and his ſenſes did abhorre the torments of his Paſſion; for otherwiſe they had bene noe torments vnto him: and as the complexion and conſtitution of his body was more perfect, ſoe was he more ſenſible of paine; and therefore the very apprehenſion of his Paſſion had a more violent effect in him, then the paines of death is euer read to haue had in any other; cauſing a ſweat of blood to runne downe to the earth from him. This would he ſuffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Paſſion, to shew that his ſorrows were aboue all ſorrows and moſt horrible to him. Yet he would preſerue his life vntill he had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Firſt for the more particular and exact relation of his Paſſion; to shew that the Prophecys were full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that had ſignifyed the time about which it should be. And ſecondly for the performance of his owne words, to shew the accomplishing of that which himſelfe had foretold, when ſpeaking of his Paſſion, he ſaid,

<note place="margin">Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</note> and could if it had peaſed him haue eſcaped all, or any part of his Paſſion, and death. This he often shewed in his life time. Sometimes when they would haue killed him, he became preſently
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98706:98"/>inuiſible to their ſight, and walked through the midſt of them without being ſeene. Sometimes he preuented them, abſenting himſelfe, ſeeing their inward thoughts and harts to be bent againſt him. Sometimes he shewed that he had power ouer their mindes, mouing them as he would, and aſſwaging the malice which was in them, vntill the hower of his ſuffering came: and when his hower was come, he came forth amongſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys, and euen then he moued multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to follow, and to glorify him; but a few dayes after when they came to apprehende him he would then be taken, and would not defende himſelfe, or be defended by others. He would with a word of his mouth ſtrike them downe to the ground, to shew that he had them in his power, and could haue freed himſelfe; but he would let them rize againe, and would goe away priſoner with them, to fullfill the will of his father by ſuffering, and dying for vs.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſuffered for the redemption of all, and redeemed all: that is by his Paſſion he purchaſed meanes for the ſaluation of all. Theſe meanes are the Sacraments of the Catholike Church. Thoſe that are baptized and receiue worthily the reſt of the Sacraments, as they are neceſſary for them, are ſaued by the merits of Chriſt in them. Thoſe that are not baptized, or receiue not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they are neceſſary for them perish not through any defect in the Paſſion of Chriſt, by which they had ſufficient meanes to be ſaued; but through their owne ſinne; becauſe they will not apply thoſe meanes to themſelues, which Chriſt by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98706:99"/>his Paſſion procured for their ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The leaſt paine of our Sauiours Paſſion, or the leaſt action which he did in his life time had bene ſufficient to haue redeemed the whole world, and a thouſand worlds, if it had bene offered to that end by him, as the full price of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; becauſe it proceeded from the diuine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which was of infinite dignity; but it was not intended ſoe by him. He ouervalued the purchaſe of our ſoules; and by a ſuperabundant grace would giue more then he needed when he gaue his life for them, and would haue nothing to ſtande for the price of our redemption without his death. This he would doe to teſtify his loue towards vs, and to giue vs an example of many vertues.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What doe we gett by Chriſt redeeming vs?</hi> Anſw. <hi>We gett the forgiuneſſe of our ſinnes, and the acceptance of our good works by the merits of Chriſts Paſſion, applyed vnto vs in the Catholike Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sacraments of the Catholike Church haue their vertue, and effect by the Paſſion of Chriſt. Thoſe that worthily receiue them are ſanctifyed, and haue the remiſſion of their ſinnes: and being then in the ſtate of grace, the good works, which in that ſtate are done by them are acceptable to God, and haue proportion to ſupernatural glory. The Sacraments therefor hauing by the merits of Chriſts Paſſion power, and vertue to ſanctify vs, we haue by his merits the forgiuneſſe of our ſinnes, and the acceptance of our good works.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:98706:99"/>
               <p>Man had committed ſinne in paradiſe, and all mankind was infected with that ſinne: and our nature being once tainted, it corrupted ſtill more and more and we fall in our life times into many actuall ſinnes. All the good works which we could doe were of noe value, nor could we by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes make ſatisfaction for any ſinne either origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or actuall; becauſe there is noe condignity in perſon and works betwixt vs and God that was offended. The Sonne of God was therefor incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in Chriſt, that the diuine nature vniting to it ſelfe the nature of man, might ſoe dignify it by that vnion in him, that he could make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſinnes, and obtaine for vs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them, and that our good works being then done in the ſtate of grace might become acceptable to God and proportionable to glory, which of themſelues they could not be. We could haue ſinned ſtill more and more, heaping ſinne vpon ſinne, and increaſing our damnation; but we could haue done nothing in that ſtate by which we could riſe from any ſinne. Soe that the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſinnes, and the acceptance of our good works to the obtaining of euerlaſting glory, is to be attributed to the merits, and power of Chriſts Paſſion, which is actually applyed vnto vs by the Sacraments of the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles would particularly profeſſe in the Creede the Paſſion of Chriſt, and that he dyed, to confounde thoſe haeretiks that should deny his death, as ſome haue done. Theſe are ſufficiently refuted by this article, and by all the Euangeliſts affirming that he <hi>gaue vp the ghoſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:98706:100"/>That is is to ſay that his ghoſt, ſpirit, or ſoule (which is all one) departed, and was ſeparated from his body; death being nohting els but the departure or ſeparation of the ſoule from the body. For this reaſon alſo the Apoſtles would declare, that Chriſt was buried, to confirme his being dead. But although he would haue his body to be buried, as the bodys of other men; yet he would preſerue it from corruption in the earth; becauſe it was moſt decent that that ſacred body, which was ſoe miraculouſly framed by the Holy Ghoſt without corrupting the Virginity of his mother, should after death be free from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: according to that which the holy king had prophecyed <hi>thou shalt not giue thy holy one to ſee corruption.</hi>

                  <hi>HE deſcended into hell, the third day he aroſe againe from death.</hi> The Apoſtles hauing in the former article profeſſed the Paſſion and death of Chriſt, declare now his victory, and triumph ouer it. That which by this article is propoſed to be beleeued is, that the ſoule of Chriſt depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in death from his body, deſcended truely into hell. For as long as his body remained in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98706:101"/>ſepulcher, his ſoule was ſeparated from it, and all that while was deſcended into hell.</p>
               <p>Some haeretiks haue wickedly denyed this article of Chriſt his deſcenſion into hell, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly vnderſtanding by hell his ſepulcher Not conſidering that his deſcending into the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher was profeſſed before in the former article; and therefor there needed not another article to repeate it ouer againe, and to ſay that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the ſepulcher. Neither is it a propper manner of ſpeech in that ſenſe: for the body of our Lord was then dead, and deſcended not, but was laid by others in the ſepulcher. This therefor can not be vnderſtoode of his body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into the ſepulcher; but of his ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into hell.</p>
               <p>Aunciently by hell ſome place in general was vnderſtoode, where the ſoules of men reſided after death; and it was not onely taken for the place of the damned, but alſo for the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the iuſt.

For the vnderſtanding of which we may deſtinguish fower places in the earth, the receptacles of ſoules departed.
<note place="margin">Fower kinds of hell.</note> Firſt there is the loweſt hell of euerlaſting damnation: which is the furtheſt place from heauen, as moſt ſuetable to thoſe whoſe liues, and actions were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98706:102"/>furtheſt of, and moſt oppoſite to God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for in reſpect of punishment it is the deepeſt hell. Secondly the next aboue that in paine, is Purgatory. Thirdly aboue purgatory is the place where the ſoules of thoſe are detained, who dy onely in original ſinne. Fourthly aboue that there was a place for the ſoules of the iuſt, that dyed before Chriſt, not hauing the guilt of any ſinne, or ſatisfaction to make for it. For it was not conuenient that any should enter into heauen before Chriſt who purchaſed it for all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for thoſe ſoules remained in an inferiour place vntill the death of Chriſt; and then he deſcending to them freed them from that place. This was ſome times called the boſome of Abraham; becauſe Abraham was the father of the elect, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized as it were in him all the iuſt as Chriſt came of his ſeede who was the head of all the iuſt. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefor did our bleſſed Sauiour deſcende, to bleſſe and to free thoſe holy ſoules. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would alſo shew himſelfe to the ſoules of purgatory, for their comfort; as alſo to the damned ſoules, for their terrour and rebuke.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was buryed on the fryday on which he ſuffered. (For the death of the Cros was held in that ignominy, that the law commanded, thoſe that were Crucifyed to be taken from the Cros on the ſame day.) After his buriall he remained in the ſepulcher all that day, and all Saturday, and part of Sunday vntill about breake of day: all which time his ſoule was deſcended into hell. Then he releaſed the iuſt out of that place in which they were detained, and brought them with him
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98706:102"/>to the ſepulcher: where vniting his ſoule and body together againe, the third day he aroſe from the dead; not as thoſe who haue bene reuiued by the power of others to a ſecond life, and to dy a ſecond death; but by his owne power he aroze againe to dy noe more. For the diuine nature being allwais preſent with his body and ſoule, as vnited with them in the vnity of perſon, he had power to raiſe himſelfe, and by his owne power he tooke life againe, and aroze glorious; and therefor he ſaid of himſelfe.

Humane nature is exalted thus high aboue all: that nature which was of it ſelfe ſoe low, that it could be noe lower, became now ſoe high, that it could be raiſed noe higher.</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt to shew how high that glory was which mankind then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, would inſpire the Apoſtles to make ſuch a remarkeable expreſſion of it, as to ſay that it was ſet at the right hand of God. That as great Princes and eminent perſonages, when they will shew a more then ordinary reſpect to ſome other Prince their freind, they ſet him on their right
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98706:104"/>hand; ſoe the nature of man in Ieſus Chriſt, who was the Prince of mankind, aſcending into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the king of heauen, and of the whole world would be ſaid to ſet him on his right hand. A greater expreſſion of his loue could not be made then this; yet thus would he haue his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to expreſſe it.</p>
               <p>Chriſt aſcended both in body and ſoule: for they being once vnited together in his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were neuer more to be ſeparated againe. He aſcended by his owne power, and not as Elias, Abacuc. S. Phillip, or others, who were eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ayre, carried by Angels: for their ſoules and bodys, being then vnglorifyed, could not by their owne power aſcende. But Chriſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he aſcended by the power of his diuinity) being in the ſtate of glory, his body was perfectly ſubiected to his ſoule, and was therefor eleuated by it: and ſtoode noe neede of the externall helpe of Angels. In that he is ſaid to ſitt at the right hand of God, we are to vnderſtande a ſiguratiue manner of ſpeech, which God would haue to be vſed, to accommodate himſelfe to our weake vnderſtandings, which can haue nothing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, but by the ſpecies of corporal thinges: and ſoe Chriſt is ſaid to ſitt at the right hand of God, to shew how highly our nature was exalted in him; although God haue noe hands, nor corporal parts; as being a ſpiritual ſubſtance that needeth not them. Neither ought we to thinke by this, that there is any preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of place, or degrees of dignity in the Perſons of the B. Trinity; but that the Father, the Sonne
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98706:104"/>and the Holy Ghoſt are all of equall and infinite dignity. Chriſt according to his humanity is ſaid to ſitte at the right hand of God, in reſpect of creatures, in that he is ſuperiour to them in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and glory. And according to his diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he may be ſaid to ſitt at the right hand of God in this ſenſe, and to this end, that we might not vnderſtande as Arius did, that the Sonne of God was inferiour to the Father.

Fourthly, being that we ſee poſterity, for the moſt part, to imitate their praedeceſſors, and to follow the wayes which they haue trodden out to them: and this imitation of good or euill praedeceſſors to laſt ſometimes for many yeares, and ages, and may laſt we know not how long: it is conuenient that there should be in the end one general day of iudgment, in which it might appeare how much euery one hath contributed to the good, or euill of others after them, euen to the end of the world Laſtly that the body and ſoule which haue accompanied together in this life, and both of them concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red iointly in their works, may meete and be vnited againe, and remaine together in pleaſure, or in paine for euer.</p>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98706:108"/>a very great ignorance in them, if they had bene Chriſtians, which they were not: (and the myſtery of the bleſſed Trinity) was to be but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely deliuered to the Iewes (as I haue shewed in another place treating of it.) They were the Diſciples of S. Iohn Baptiſt, baptized by his baptiſme, which could not giue the Holy Ghoſt, and were not as yet baptized with chriſtian bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, in which the Holy Ghoſt is giuen; and therfor it was a leſſe ignorance in them But for any of vs not to know what the Holy Ghoſt is, were an extreame ignorance. And therefor we will firſt declare who the Holy Ghoſt is, and why he is ſoe called.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt is the third Perſon of the B. Trinity: and is as much as to ſay. The holy ſpirit. And although the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Angels, are holy ſpirits; yet they are not The Holy Ghoſt of whom we are ſpeaking. When therefor we ſay the Holy Ghoſt we meane the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt; as when Chriſt commanded baptiſme in the name of the Father and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt. The firſt Perſon of the bleſſed Trinity is called The Father becauſe the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt proceede from him. The ſecond Perſon is called The Sonne, becauſe he proceedeth as ſonne from the Father. The third Perſon is called the Holy Ghoſt, or holy ſpirit, becauſe he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Father and the Sonne, by way of mutuall inſpiration.</p>

               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Catholike Church?</hi> Anſw. <hi>The Catholike Church is the congregation of all faithfull Paſtors, and people, vnited together, as a body with its head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. Auguſtine defineth the Church to be the congregation of all the faithfull diſperſed ouer the world. Which is in ſubſtance the ſame that is here anſwered: for euery one that hath the true faith, and is in vnion with the head, and Paſtors of the Church, by obeying them, is a member of the true Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But becauſe Schiſmatiks although they beleeue in all points; yet are out of the Church, as diuiding themſelues from it by diſobedience to the head and Paſtors theirof, therefor to be a member of the Church we require vnion with the reſt of the members vnder one head, to wit the Pope, who is for the time the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98706:109"/>ſucceſſor of S. Peter, the Vicar of Chriſt, and the Head of the Church. Now for the explication of this article.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place the Church is ſaid to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<note place="margin">Holy.</note> It is holy in diuerſe reſpects Firſt in reſpect of the eminent holines of Ieſus Chriſt, the cheife head of it. Secondly for the holy gouernment which Chriſt inſtituted, and allwais conſerueth in it. Thirdly it is holy in reſpect of the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which it hath of his moſt ſacred body, and in reſpect of the holy Sacraments and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances that are in it. Fourthly in reſpect of the Vicarhead Paſtors, and people, whoſe holineſſe it includeth. Chriſt aſcending into heauen made S. Peter the head of all the Apoſtles, and of the whole Church to remaine as Vicar to himſelfe vpon earth, commending particularly to him the charge of his sheepe; that is of all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full chriſtians that are in the Church, as in his sheepfold. This charge was performed by him whilſt he liued; and after his death by men of great holines, who ſucceeded him; ioyning their blood vnto his, as it were in a continuall ſtreame of martyrdome, for almoſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt. After them thoſe who haue ſucceeded in that chaire and office, haue bene for the moſt part men of great holineſſe; as they haue great meanes to be, and as it is fitting they should be in that holy office. The Church is alſo holy in many other inferiour Paſtors, and people of all ſorts, and callings; of Martyrs, Confeſſors, and Virgins, who haue illuſtrated it with their holy liues, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98706:110"/>haue rendred it a deere, and amiable ſpouſe to Chriſt. Laſtly the Church is holy as being by its authority the ground of all holines, there being none at all but in it For there can be noe holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this world if not grounded vpon true faith,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> without which it is <hi>impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And being there can be noe faith that can pleaſe God but in the Catholike Church, all holineſſe that is amongſt men is in the holy Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>The Church is called by the Apoſtles <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Catholike.</note> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>vniuerſal,</hi> to deſtinguish the true Church of Chriſt from all falſe Churches of chriſtians, which they ſaw might rize vp in following times, and did euen then beginne to rize in their times. None of which can be ſaid to be Catholike or vniuerſal; but priuate and particular Churches, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne by oppoſing of the Catholike and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal Church, then extant when thoſe new ſects beginne. Firſt the Church is vniuerſal in doctrine, for that it teacheth all ouer the ſame doctrine, and yeeldeth obedience to the ſame gouernment, vnder one head: and ſoe the Church of Rome is Catholike, and the Church of Proteſtants is not Catholike for that proteſtants agree in name onely, and nor in doctrine: and alſo becauſe ſome of them acknowledging a head vpon earth; (as the English Proteſtants did) and ſome of them acknowledging noe head vpon earth, they haue not all obedience to the ſame authority; which obedience muſt neceſſarily be had to be the ſame Church, and to be the true
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98706:110"/>Catholike Church. For the Apoſtles made this article to keepe vs allwais in the odedience of the true Church, and that thoſe might be knowne to haue the true faith of Chriſt, who retaining the doctrine which is profeſſed by the whole Church, which then is, and obeying the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, ſubmitte in all controuerſys to that which it teacheth, and ſay with the Apoſtles <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church;</hi> and therefor two Churches, that obey two different authoritys, can not both of them be vniuerſal and Catholike. Secondly the true Church is vniuerſall in times: for that it muſt be at all times, and neuer ſoe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of the world, that there should neede any to reſtore it againe: for God doth not ſoe vnequally deſtribute his graces as to leaue the the world at any time without meanes of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which cannot be without a true, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Church. Beſides the Apoſtles Creede is to be ſaid at all times; and ſoe we are allwais to ſay <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church:</hi> which we could not allwais ſay, if at ſome time there were noe true Catholike Church in the world. Thirdly the Church is vniuerſal in place: for if S. Paul could with truth apply thoſe words of the pſalme <hi>their ſounde hath gone forth vnto all the earth;</hi>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98706:111"/>of the world, whither the Catholike Church doth not ſend her ſubiects to preach.</p>
               <p>Out of this vniuerſality of the Church it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<note place="margin">One.</note> that there is but one true Church in which ſaluation may be had: for vniuerſality importeth vnity: and if there be vnity in the Church, and that this vnity be neceſſarily required, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the word <hi>Catholike</hi> or <hi>vniuerſal;</hi> which ſignifye h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> many agreeing in the ſame thinge; then two Churches which are not vnited in the ſame Communion, and obedience to the ſame authority, can not both of them haue meanes of ſaluation: for if they could both haue meanes of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet might lawfully diſobey each others authority; then we should not be bounde to obey it nor could it lawfully require obedience to it: which is contrary to the words of Chriſt binding vs to the obedience of the Church, and contrary to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and to all reaſon and gouernment. S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine <hi>There is nothing which a chriſtian ought ſoe much to feare as to be ſeparated from the body of Chriſt,</hi>

                  <hi>which is for certaine the one Catholike Church. For if he be ſeparated from the body of Chriſt, he is not a member of him. If he be not a member of him, he is not nourished with his ſpirit.</hi> By which it is plane in the doctrine of this ſaint, that it can not be a true Church which is ſeparated from the true Church; and by conſequence two Churches, which ſeparate from each other can not both be true. Therefor let thoſe take head that hearken to that bold perſuaſion of ſome, who perſwade themſelues, that ſaluation may be had in any religion, or in either of ſome two reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98706:111"/>or in any faith ſoe that they beleeue in Chriſt; for they shall finde one day, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the true Church is a ſinne which deſerueth damnation. S. Auguſtine againe in another place.

                  <hi>Being out of the Church and diuided from the heape of vnity, and the bond of charity, thou shouldſt be punished with eternal fire, although thou shouldſt be burned aliue for the name of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church is honored in the ſcriptures with many noble, and glorious titles.
<note place="margin">The titles of Church.</note> It is called the kingdome of God, the houſe of God, his ſpouſe, his faire one, his onely one, and the very body of Chriſt. He gouerneth it as his kingdome, he prouideth for it as his houſehold, and loueth it as his deere ſpouſe, and as his owne body; pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delighting himſelfe in the ſoules of good Catholikes that ſerue him. It is compared to the holy city of Hieruſalem, in which the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God flourished, and in which diuine ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was duely offered. It is compared to the arke of Noë out of which there was noe ſaluation; but a general death and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Infidels that haue not the faith of Chriſt are out of the Church. Haeretiks, Schiſmatiks and excommunicated perſons although they beleeue in Chriſt; yet becauſe they heare not the Church, that is obey it not, they are alſo our of it, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that participate not the benefits of it.</p>
               <p>The Catholike Church hath two parts,
<note place="margin">The trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans and militant Church.</note> the one Triumphant, the other Militant. The Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Church is the company of bleſſed ſoules in heauen: who hauing gotten victory ouer their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98706:112"/>ſpirituall enemys in this life, are now triumphing in euerlaſting glory. The Militant Church is the company of the faithfull vpon earth, liuing as it were in a warrfare, where we are allwais fighting with the enemys of our ſoules, and by perſeuering vnto the end in the ſeruice of God, we shall be crowned like good and faithfull ſouldiers. The Militant Church conteineth both good and euill liuers,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.</note> and therefor it is compared to a field that beareth both good corne, and cockle; to a nette that gathereth together both good, and euill fish. The good are kept,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</note> but the bad are throwne away. It is compared to tenne virgins, fiue of which were wiſe, and had prepared the light of good works againſt the comming of Chriſt to reward them;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</note> and therefor they were admitted into his heauenly nuptials; but the other fiue came like fooles, and although they had the faith of Chriſt, and were chriſtians; yet wanting the oile of the loue of God, and the light of good works, they were excluded from his bleſſed ioyes. By theſe and the like places we are giuen to vnderſtande, that it is not enough to haue the true faith, and to be Catholikes, if our liues be diſſonant from our profeſſion, that we liue not like good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes: for there are many euill liuers in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, who as bundles of cockle shall be throwne into the fire.</p>

The reaſon is becauſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church is as it were one body, and all the members of it liue by the ſame ſpirit of the Holy Ghoſt, and of Ieſus Chriſt, who keepe them in that holy vnion, and Communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And as all the members of the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre and helpe to the good of each other; ſoe euery member of the Catholike Church helpeth to the good of the reſt, and receiueth good by the reſt, participating of their good works.

                  <p>BY theſe words of the Creede it appeareth that the Catholike Church is of diuine authority: for euery article of the Creede being of diuine authority; and we being by this article bound to beleeue the Church; it followeth that the Church hath diuine authority, and that we are bounde to beleeue, and to obey it, as hauing the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God. And therefor this article was moſt profitably, and neceſſarily made by the Apoſtles, as the ground and foundation of diuine faith and worship. For although in the ſcriptures it be plane, and by reaſon muſt needes be true, that we are allwais to be gouerned by the authority of the Church; yet this article being ſoe commonly and often profeſſed, it is agreat curbe to the rizing of new ſects and haereſys, all which beginne in the diſobedience of ſome priuate men to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the whole Church: and it can not but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98706:113"/>be a horrour to their mindes, and a greeuous wounde to their owne conſciences, to ſee how they contradict the common Creede of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. And therefor S. Paul might well ſay that <hi>a man that is an haeretike is ſubuerted and ſinneth;</hi>

                  <p>The authority of the Church is diuine in that it is declared alſo by the ſcriptures: and that in innumerable places, which for breuity I omitte, and will mention onely the words of our Sauiour, which he ſpoke to his diſciples at his laſt farewell from them. Chriſt in his Aſcenſion being to leaue his Apoſtles with a hard taske, and difficult worke which they were to performe in founding of the Catholike Church amongſt ſoe many enemys, he told them for their comfort,

As long then as Chriſt was to be with them their doctrine was for euer to be true and their authority diuine; and he being to be with them vnto the conſummation of the world, their doctrine was to be true and their authority diuine vnto the conſummation of the world, as the doctrine and authority of Chriſt, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed allwais to aſſiſt them in their worke: and ſoe their worke was his worke, and their doctrine and authority were his. Chriſt therfor is allwais with the Paſtors of the Church when they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and haue the authority of the whole Church;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98706:114"/>not with euery one of them particularly, but with all of them together; and therefor although any one particular bishop, as he is onely a particular member of the Church may erre; yet all bishops cannot poſſibly erre at any time; becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed to be with them all dayes.</p>
                  <p>It is not needfull to produce the ſentences of fathers for the diuine authority of the Church; both becauſe theſe words of the Creede made by the Apoſtles, and at all times conſented vnto by the fathers <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church</hi> may ſtande for their ſentences; and alſo becauſe their ſentences to this purpoſe will frequently occurre in that, which I haue to ſay of the Church. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fathers are eaſily miſconſtrued by haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, who make them to ſpeake as they will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande them: or if they be too plane againſt them, they diſcarde the ſentence, or the whole booke. For thoſe that are ſoe bold as to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the whole Church haue loſt their shame, and neede regard noe authority at all But becauſe they pretende reaſon, as building all their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines vpon their owne witts; and becauſe this point is ſoe neceſſary for the deciding of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſys, and to the true and lawfull condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all haereſys; we will make it euident by plane and eaſy reaſons, which all may vnderſtande.</p>
                  <p>To thinke to haue religion without the diuine authority of an infallible Church, is to thinke to build without a foundation, or as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay to build caſtles in the ayre; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all true religion being the authority of the Church which profeſſeth it. Grant once
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98706:114"/>that a Church may erre (as it may if it be not ſupported by the diuine authority) and we can not be certaine of any doctrine which it teacheth; and being vncertaine of the truth of its doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, we are not bound to beleeue vncertaintys, and it can not be the true religion, if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by a Church which we are not bounde to beleeue. And therefor the firſt thinge, which is to be eſtablished as the foundation of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is the infallible and conſequently diuine authority of the Church that profeſſeth it. Take once away the authority of the Church, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue men from the obedience of it, and you make euery man his owne maſter, and leauing him to himſelfe to beleeue what he liſteth, all is brought into vncertainty and confuſion: for there is noe point of faith ſoe certaine, nor any thinge ſoe cleere, but by prowde and contentious men it might be brought into queſtion.</p>
                  <p>This is declared by particular inſtances. If the Church of Chriſt were not of diuine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and infallible certainty in all which it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we could not be certaine either of the Creede, or of the ſcriptures, or of the ſenſe of either of them, or of any article of faith what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; nay the very foundation of all religion would be deſtroyed, the diuine exiſtence becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming alſo vncertaine to vs; and inſteede of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, vnion, and order in the worship of God, we should haue noe diuine worship, nor God, at all; but a horrible confuſion, and more then hellish diſorder would dwell vpon earth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the Creede is not receiued but for the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98706:115"/>authority of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We beleeue that euery article of the Creede was made by diuine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and authority, and as ſuch we will defende them with our liues; yet this we know not but by the Church: for of our ſelues we could not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely know it, nor should we beleeue it of the Creede more then of other writings, which we receiue not as of faith, but that the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs ſoe to beleeue of it, and not of them. Againe we doe not know the ſenſe of any article of the Creede, but by the authority of the Church: take away this and we had the ſenſe of them to ſeeke we knew not where: euery one might follow his owne ſenſe, and we should be certaine of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but of vncertainty and confuſion. Take away the diuine and infallible authority of the Church in the Apoſtles times, and you bring all into vncertainty whatſoeuer they taught, and ruine the foundation of the whole chriſtian faith, and it had bene noe matter what they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the Creede, or whether they had made any Creede at all. Take away that authority from the Church of Chriſt that is at all times; and it is noe matter what Creede it deliuer, or what ſenſe of the Creede; ſeeing it may erre in that which it ſayeth, and thoſe thinges may be falſe which it deliuereth for true.</p>
                  <p>The ſame appeareth in the ſcriptures. We beleeue that ſuch and ſuch ſcriptures were written by ſome that had the ſpirit of God to write no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth in them; that all thoſe bookes which we receiue were written with that ſpirit; and that all thoſe bookes paſſing through ſoe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98706:115"/>many hands, and handwritings, as muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily haue bene before printing was inuented, haue remained vncorrupted vntill our times. How doe we know all this to be ſoe, but by the authority of the Church? deny this, as all hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks doe to follow their owne phanſys, and you may admitte of what Scriptures you will, or if you will, you may deny all ſcriptures. And this we ſee by experience to be true, that haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks reiecting the authority of the Church, and diſobeying it, reiect alſo the ſcriptures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue but what they will. The Carpocratites, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerians and Manichees reiected all the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all the foure ghoſpels of the new, except that of S. Luke. Cerdon and Cerinthus reiected S. Luke. The Seuerians reiected the acts of the Apoſtles, and all the Epiſtles of S. Paul. Luther and ſome Proteſtants reiect the Epiſtle of S. Iames. The Alogians and ſome Proteſtants reiect the Apocalypſe. And Suencfeldius ſeeing ſuch a ſtrife about the ſcriptures, cleered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe readily, in a word reiecting all. Soe that if we might contradict the Church, and follow either our owne, or the conceits of any priuate men, we might reiect the true ſcriptures, as theſe haue done, and receiue falſe ſcriptures, as the Apocryphi did, or deny all ſcriptures as Suenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius, Quintinus, the Libertines and other haeretiks haue done. The authority of the Church bindeth vs to receiue ſcriptures, and appointeth what ſcriptures we should receiue: and for that authority we receiue the ghoſpell, which S. Marke wrote who was noe Apoſtle, and not that of S.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98706:116"/>Thomas who was an Apoſtle, and we reiect the ghoſpell of Nicodemus, who had ſeene Chriſt, and receiue the ghoſpell of S. Luke who neuer ſaw him. Therfor we muſt ground our ſelues vpon the authority of the Church, and obey it, or els we should not know what ſcriptures to receiue. S. Auguſtine hath ſaid this in plane ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiſ. fund. c.</hi> 5.</note> when he ſaid that he <hi>would not beleeue the ghoſpell but for the authority of the Church.</hi> And addeth that for the ſame authority he would not beleeue Manichaeus the haereticke.</p>
                  <p>Further more the word of the ſcriptures is not profitable to vs, but in its true ſenſe; and that true ſenſe can not be knowne but by a true interpretour; which euery priuate man, as we ſee, is not: for although there be a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in the abilitys of men excelling one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; yet noe man of himſelfe is free from errour, and can but by his owne reaſon probably affirme that, which another may probably deny; and therfor all priuate opinions muſt be referred vnto ſome certaine authority, which muſt decide all controuerſys in the ſenſe of the ſcriptures. Beſides the ſcriptures in themſelues are ſoe hard to be vnderſtoode and full of difficultys; that it were againſt reaſon to leaue euery man to his owne ſenſe and conſtruction of them. They haue beſide the litteral ſenſe many kindes of allegorys, in which if we should follow the letter, it would kill vs. The deuill alleadged the letter and word of holy ſcriptures; but in a falſe ſenſe to tempt Chriſt; and Chriſt refuted him by the words of ſcripture in their true ſenſe: but if we had
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98706:116"/>not at all times the like authority of Chriſt in the Church, the deuill would eaſily peruert the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to vs, and we should be ſubiect to continuall errors. S. Peter ſaith that in the Epiſtles of S. Paul <hi>there are certaine thinges hard to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode which the vnlearned and vnſtable depraue as alſo the reſt of the ſcriptures to their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> and S. Auguſtine,

The ſenſe of the ſcriptures is ſoe depraued by haeretiks, that Luther called the ſcriptures the booke of haeretiks; euery haeretike alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Simon Magus would giue ſoe much honour to the Angels, that he would haue them our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors aboue Chriſt, and he alleadged ſcriptures and reaſon for this doctrine: Proteſtants honour them ſoe litle, that they will not grant them any mediation at all, neither v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>der Chriſt; and they alſo alleadge ſcriptures and reaſons for their doctrine. The Manichees forbadde ſome meates as in themſelues vnlawfull to be eaten, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged ſcriptures and reaſon for this doctrine: Proteſtants allow of all meates to be eaten at all times, (although it be againſt the praecep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the Church) and alleadge alſo ſcriptures and reaſon for their doctrine The Marcioniſts Encratites, and other haeretiks forbadde marriage as vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98706:117"/>and alleadged ſcriptures and reaſons for this doctrine: Proteſtants eſteeme ſoe highly of marriage that they make it lawfull for virgins and religious perſons that haue dedicated and vowed their chaſtity to God, and alleadge alſo ſcriptures, and reaſons for it. Pelagius attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our good works to our owne natural forces, and to freewill more then to grace; and hath more shew of ſcriptures, then moſt haeretiks haue for their doctrines: Proteſtants on the contrary grant noe freewill at all, and will not want ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nor reaſons for themſelues. Thus you haue two contrary doctrines both of them alleadging ſcriptures, and both of them in a falſe ſenſe, the truth being betwixt them both (ſaith a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed authour) as Chriſt was betwixt two theeues.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mald in Io.</hi> 6.</note> But how doe we know that neither of them hath the true ſenſe of the ſcriptures? We know it by the authority of the whole Church, which at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt thoſe doctrines: and therefor who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer shall obſtinatly mainteine them are haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks; becauſe they deny the ninth article of the Creede, not beleeuing the Catholike Church; but ſtanding obſtinate againſt all authority that was then in the world. Which if at any time it were lawfull to doe; then were there none to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete the ſcriptures, and to deſtinguish betwixt ſenſe and ſenſe, and reaſon and reaſon; and we might as well haue noe ſcriptures at all, as haue noe meanes to know the true ſenſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly if there were not at all times ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority amongſt men infallibly aſſiſted of God to gouerne, and direct in his worship, and to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98706:117"/>determine the verity of all propoſitions, that were to be beleeued with diuine faith; then might euery man beleeue and ſay what he liked, and all order and gouernment were taken away, and vtmoſt diſorder would reigne amongſt vs, euen to the denying of God. For although natural reaſon doth declare the diuine exiſtence, and a demonſtration may be made by a good Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher to prooue it; yet liberty would induce to that which is againſt reaſon, and would draw into atheiſme as it doth to other vices which by the reaſon, and nature of all men are abhorred. Beſides not one man among a thouſand can make that demonſtration; and what then should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thoſe that can not, if they were to forſake the authority of the Church, and follow onely their owne reaſons? should he onely be ſaued that can make it? noe nor he neither by that, which were but a natural knowledge, and humane faith in him.</p>
                  <p>Out of all which it followeth, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church hath diuine authority to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all veritys, and to decide all controuerſys of faith, and to direct vs infallibly in that which we are to beleeue, and to doe in relation to the honour of God: or els the Creede had bene in vaine, as alſo the ſcriptures; all proofe of reaſon had bene vncertaine, all vnion and orderly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and the very foundation of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were vtterly deſtroyed; and therfor one may as well ſay I will haue noe Creede, nor religion at all, as to ſay I will haue or beleeue noe Church: and thoſe onely remaine ſure and ſecute from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98706:118"/>errour that at all times, in all controuerſys follow the ſentence of the Church, and adhaere to it. And therfor the Apoſtles by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt made this important article, that we might neuer forgett our obedience to the Church, but that in all doubts and difficultys we might haue recourſe to it, and ſay <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church.</hi> And that thoſe who will ſtande againſt it may be knowne to be infringers of the law, and Creede of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>From hence is the beginning of all hereſys, that ſome priuate men will contradict the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole Church, and obiecting againſt ſome particular point, or points of faith, they make themſelues the iudges, and determine as they will themſelues. They contende allwais about ſome particular point, or points of faith, and wrangle about them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if you aske them vpon what authority they contradict the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, and all the Churches in the world, ſeparating from them? they are then out of their witts, and know not what to ſay; knowing that if they pretende the word of God, the ſame queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion confoundeth them againe, demanding vpon what authority they dare interprete the word of God againſt the Catholike Church, and againſt all the Churches in the world? beſides that the word of God is againſt them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding both in the Creede, and ſcriptures to beleeue the Church. If we will giue them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in thoſe particular points, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys, it is but of curteſy; for we confeſſe that there are many points of faith, which by our owne
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98706:118"/>reaſon we cannot comprehende: the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and beſt ſatisfaction is becauſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church ſoe teacheth: otherwiſe as I haue shewed we should neither haue Creede, nor ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor God. Contende not then with hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks about particular points; but aske them vpon what authority they dare queſtion them? what Church will they follow? If they will fall from the Catholike Church to ſome company of haeretiks, that beganne at ſome time againſt all Churches, or if themſelues will beginne ſuch a company, they are here condemned in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. The authority of the Church is the rule, the guide, the ſure anker, to which we muſt all wais hold.

Firſt it was a moſt ſingular high myſtery that which Chriſt asked, and Peter then profeſſed; and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then perhaps was neuer reuealed to any of the Apoſtles, and which flesh and blood could not reueale; that is by humane meanes could not be vnderſtoode. Moreouer Chriſt then bleſſed him, and ſpoke vnto him after a moſt particular, and energious manner of ſpeech, calling him a rocke: which was not his name, nor had ary relation to him, more then to the reſt of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but in reſpect of ſome myſtery, to wit as he was to be the prime foundation of the Church amongſt them. Then the keyes of the kingdome of heauen were particularly promiſed to him, hauing firſt called him a rocke, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to build his Church vpon that rocke. Which can not be vnderſtoode of Chriſt; for Chriſt ſpoke not then to himſelfe; but to Simon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Church was then all ready builded vpon Chriſt; but here he ſpeaketh for the future, and promiſeth that it should be builded vpon Simon, whom he called Peter: and ſaid <hi>thou art a rocke, and vpon this rocke I will build my Church;</hi> and therefor he muſt not be vnderſtoode then to ſay, that he would build it vpon another rocke, and not vpon that. For although the Church were build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cheefly vpon Chriſt; yet then he ſpoke of Simon, and therefor it muſt be builded vpon
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98706:120"/>him alſo: to whom he then alſo ſaid <hi>I will giue to thee.</hi> By all which it is manifeſt to any that hath not the ſpirit of contradiction, and wrangling about any thinge, that Chriſt did not ſay here that he would build his Church vpon himſelfe; but vpon Simon, whom therefor he called <hi>a rocke.</hi> And vnto this all the holy fathers agree, that he founded his Church vpon S. Peter; although they grant alſo that which is true, to wit that the Church was founded vpon Chriſt; and alſo vpon Peters Confeſſion, as a meanes and preparation for the building of it upon his perſon.</p>
                  <p>That which Chriſt here promiſed, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performed, when before his Aſcenſion he ſpoke to Peter, and gaue vnto him the care of his flocke, asking him firſt,

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98706:121"/>ſoe he should profeſſe his loue eſpecially aboue the reſt, when he gaue him that authority.

                  <p>Neither doth the ſupremacy of Chriſt ouer the Church hinder the ſupremacy of S Peter in ſpiritual affaires, any more then his ſupremacy in temporal power hindereth the ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of temporal Princes in temporal affaires. Chriſt of himſelfe was the head of all authority, both ſpiritual and temporall; but after his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into heauen, he being viſibly abſent from vs, as he left kings with ſupreme authority in the temporal gouernment of their kingdomes; ſoe alſo he left one head to haue ſupreme authority vnder him in the gouernment of the Church, which is his cheife kingdome conteining all the kingdomes of the world; and therefor ſtoode much more neede of a head to gouerne and keepe vnity in it. This as I haue shewed could be none but S. Peter whilſt he liued, for that Chriſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Church on him, gaue vnto him the keyes of heauen, and made him the paſtour of all his sheepe in ſuch circumſtances, as are moſt euident for it. Moreouer he is firſt named in the catalogue of the Apoſtles,

The auncient and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98706:122"/>holy fathers of the Church acknowledge, as you haue ſeene his ſupreme authority. And if all this be not ſufficient; let it ſuffize that it is the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Catholike Church: what vpſtart teacher will beginne to contradict it? or who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and follow him?</p>
                  <p>It was very neceſſary that Chriſt should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine one head, and ſupreme power in the Church, for the keeping of vnity and concord in it; and that in all difficultys which should arize the Paſtors of the Church might be called together by the cheife head, the place of their meeting might be aſſigned by him, and they be kept in vnity by obeying his authority.

The reſt of the Apoſtles were that which Peter was. The primacy was giuen to Peter, that the Church of Chriſt might appeare to be one, and one chaire.</hi> S. Hierome <hi>Although all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in Apoſtleship were alike; yet Chriſt for the better keeping of vnity, and truth, would haue one to be the head of them all; that a head being once conſtituted, occaſion of ſchiſme might be taken away.</hi> By which we ſee how neceſſary it was, in the opinion of theſe ſaints, that one should be eſtablished, as the ſupreme paſtour and head of the Church, and that although all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had the ſame power as bishops, and had their authority immediatly from Chriſt himſelfe; and ſoe the Church was alſo founded vpon them, that is vpon their neceſſary functions; yet it was cheifly founded vpon S. Peter, as the Primate and ſupreme paſtour ouer all, who had alſo from Chriſt himſelfe the lawfull execution of that authority.</p>
                  <p>Now if one ſupreme head was conſtituted of Chriſt as neceſſary to keepe vnity and preuent ſchiſmes in the Church of God; the gouernment of the Church required euer after, that ſupreme power to remaine in ſucceſſors to him; and it was not to continue onely for thirty ſix, or thirty ſeauen yeares, as long as S. Peter liued; there being afterwards as much, if not more neede of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98706:123"/>it; ſchiſmes and hereſys being as likely to rize in the Church after the Apoſtles dayes, when it was deſtitute of their preſence, as when it had their helpe and aſſiſtance; and S. Cyprian as you ſee maketh this to be the origen of all ſchiſmes and hereſys, becauſe they ſeeke not to the head. And therefor, as I shall shew in the next title, it is a ſufficient deſtinction to diſcerne all falſe Churches by, that they beginne allwais in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the head of the Church, and the Paſtors of his Communion. But hauing ſpoken of the head of the Church, in the next place we will ſpeake of Generall Councels.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hauing choſen Apoſtles to gouerne the Church,
<note place="margin">General Councells.</note> and amongſt the Apoſtles one to be the head; theſe then had the authority of the whole Church, and all were bounde to obey them. When therefor the general neceſſity of the Church requireth, for the preuenting of ſchiſmes or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſys, or the deciding of any controuerſys that a Generall Councell should be called, the head of the Church exercizeth his ſupreme authority, ſummoning the Paſtors together, and appointing a place of meeting for them: who conſulting and reſoluing vpon thoſe queſtions; their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are to be imbraced by all, as hauing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Chriſt himſelfe, who made him the lawfull head, and them the lawfull Paſtors of his Communion, in place of S. Peter and the Apoſtles; to whom the Holy Ghoſt was ſent for their aſſiſtance, and whom Chriſt promiſed to be with vnto the conſummation of the world. Thus did S. Peter with ſome other paſtors of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98706:124"/>Church, that could conueniently be preſent, meete at Hieruſalem: and hauing ended their conſultation they rehearſed their decrees, and doubted not to call them the decrees of the Holy Ghoſt,

Some times Emperours and Prince, are preſent at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councells to grace, and protect them from turbulent men; but they giue not their voices in any thinge. Soe Conſtantine the firſt chriſtian Emperour was preſent in the firſt General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nyce, but how? he came in the laſt of all, and hauing a litle low ſeate ſette for him, he ſatte not downe vntill the bishops made him a ſigne to ſitt downe. And as for the decrees of the Councell we reade that three hundred, and eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene bishops ſubſcribed to them; but not that Conſtantine euer ſubſcribed. Soe alſo men of more ſanctity of life and eminent in abilitys, although not bishops are ſometimes called to aſſiſt in General Councels; but not to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or to ſubſcribe to the decrees by their owne authority.</p>
                  <p>The gouernment therefor which Chriſt ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Church was by S. Peter, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; that is to ſay by one head, or cheife bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, and by inferiour bishops vnder him. And their authority is moſt full, and obliging when it ſpeaketh by a General Councell. Then the head of the Church exercizeth more fully his ſupreme authority, calling together the paſtors of the world, and aſſigning to them the place of their meeting. The bishops and others, who for ſanctity, wiſdome, and learning are in reaſon to be thought the beſt deſeruing of the whole
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98706:127"/>world, are preſent at them. Being come together ſolemne dayes of prayer are inſtituted for the inuocation of the Holy Ghoſt. Euery one of this abſolute company hath then liberty to ſpeake his minde freely, and by the grounds of his owne religion, is bounde not to diſſemble, but to ſpeake the truth according to his conſcience; they being for the moſt part meere ſtrangers to one another. All things being well examined they ſubſcribe in order, firſt the head bishop, and then the reſt after him, according to their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This is the harmony which Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his Church, of people concording with their paſtors, and of paſtors with their ſupreme head. Now what more ſatisfaction can our ſoules deſire, then from ſuch an aſſembly of ſoe many holy and learned men, who haue the voyce of the whole Catholike Church, and the aſſiſtance of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt? Let any chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſpeake truely, and he muſt needes confeſſe that it would be a horrour to his conſcience, and that his owne thoughts would condemne him of errour, if he were condemned by ſuch an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

                  <p>And this diſobedience is not onely the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe of all falſe Churches, and a deſtinctiue ſigne to diſcerne them by; but it is the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential forme which conſtituteth them in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of falſe Churches, and maketh them to be ſuch. For noe man can be a member of a falſe Church for falſe doctrine onely; except it be ioyned with obſtinacy, and diſobedience to the Church. A good Catholike may hold, or reach falſe doctrine of ignorance, or mindeleſneſſe; but he is not a Catholike if he mainteine any thinge obſtinatly againſt the authority of the Church. In points which are diſputed by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and Catholike diuines, affirmed by ſome, and denyed by others, a falſehood is taught on one ſide; but noe errour in faith, is committed, nor the ſinne of ſchiſme, or haereſy is incurred; becauſe the head and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Church hauing declared nothing in thoſe points, there is noe diſobedience to the Church by them. S. Cyprian and the bishops of Affrica erred in doctrine and opinion, when they thought that the baptiſme of haeretiks was not valid; but they erred not in faith; becauſe the Church had then declared nothing of it; and therefor it was noe formal errour, or hereſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was noe diſobedience to the Church. <hi>I may erre</hi> ſay the fathers commonly alleadged <hi>but I will neuer be an haeretike.</hi> Errour is of the minde and vnderſtanding, but hereſy is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the will: to be allwais free from errour we can not, but from ſchiſme, and hereſy, we may if we will. It is then willfull diſobedience to the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98706:129"/>head and paſtors of the Church that conſtituteth all falſe Churches: and it is obedience to the head and paſtors of the Church, that conſerueth vs in the true Church.

If therefor you ſee any one to beginne ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of doctrine contrary to that which is taught in the Church, ſuſpect preſently ſuch a man, as tainted at leaſt with a dangerous humour of pride, if not with inward hereſy: but iudge him not an haeretike vntill his errour be made manifeſt by the authority of the Church, and he ſtande ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

We should pitty ſuch a man with all our harts, and pray for him, as for our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but we ought to auoide his conuerſation, as the breath of one infected with the plague. But if you ſee that he gette followers to ioyne with him, and to mainteine his diſobedience to the head and paſtors of the Church; you haue then in them a falſe Church, and thoſe that mainteine their diſobedience, though neuer ſoe long after, are all members of the ſame falſe Church: and thoſe that keepe in vnion and obedience to their head and paſtors, are the true Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p>Now chriſtians you haue for ener a preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt all ſchiſmes and hereſys that may hereafter arize: you shall preſently deſtinguish the true Church from the falſe by this noble cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizant, to wit obedience to the head and paſtors of the Church: and the falſe you shall diſcerne it, by the infamous brand of pride, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them.

                     <hi>but for that the Prieſt of God is not obeyed, nor one iudge conſidered to be for the time in the Church of God.</hi> Soe that to shew who is the true head of the Church will ſufficiently deſtinguish the true Church: for the paſtors that communicate with him are the true paſtors, and the people of that Communion are the true peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and that whole congregation of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and people being taken alltogether, is the whole Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p>Now to shew who is the true head of the Church we muſt ſecke into antiquity, and ſee what bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op did aunciently in the firſt Church of the Apoſtles, and in the primitiue times after them beare that authority, and was then acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the head, and ſupreme paſtour of the Church. For as truth which was eternally in God was before falſehood which came afterwards by creatures; and as true and lawfull power was firſt in the true Church of Chriſt, and falſe vſurped power was afterwards begunne by diſobeving it; ſoe he that was firſt acknowledged in the primitiue times of the Church, as the head and ſupreme paſtour, he and his ſucceſſors are all wais to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged after him: and they are falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that haue begunne at any time in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, and to the paſtors of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee what bishop was acknowledged in the primitiue times, and was firſt obeyed, as the head and ſupreme paſtour, and which of all Churches that how are retaine ſtill their obedience
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98706:131"/>to him. Theſe are either all or the cheife chriſtian Churches that are now in the world. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church which is truely Catholike, and Vniuerſal ouer the whole world: the Greeke Churches which are not Catholike nor vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall in the world (although ſome of them be much ſpred:) The Church of the Georgians, of the Armenians, of the Aethiopians, of the Arians, of the Neſtorians, of the Waldenſes, of the Lutherans, of the Zuinglians (if any of them be yet extant deſtinct from the Caluiniſts) the Church of the Caluiniſts, and the Church of England, which is the lateſt, and neweſt of them all. If there be any more beſides theſe (as we ſee petty ſects daily to arize out of the later and to beginne in diſobedience to them, as all of them once did to the Romane Church) both they and all the reſt, beſide the Romane Church, shall appeare to be falſe Churches, and it onely to be the true Catholike Church; for that it onely is in vnion and holdeth obedience to the true and lawfull head of the vniuerſall Church, and to the paſtors of his Communion; all the reſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying that authority.</p>
                  <p>But firſt it is to be obſerued that the word <hi>Church,</hi> being a word of Communion, ſigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a company of people communicating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame faith, and vnder the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; it can not be the ſame Church, and a lawfull Church, if it haue not the ſame, and that a lawfull authority. Secondly; ſome of theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a head, and ſupreme paſtour of the Church vpon earth, and others of them will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98706:132"/>none The Romane Church all ouer the world acknowledgeth the bishop of Rome to be vpon earth the head and ſupreme paſtour of the Church. The Graecians, Armenians. Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, Aethiopians and Churches of the eaſt haue ſome of them the Parriarke of Conſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inople, others the Patriarke of Alexandria or a parricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and propper paſtour to themſelues whom they acknowledge for the ſupreme head of their Church, and the Church of England vntill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe tenne or dozen yeares acknowledged their temporal prince, man, woman, or child that was for the time, to be the head of that Church. Others there are who are headleſſe, acknowledging noe ſupreme head vpon earth in any ſpirituall power; as the Lutherans, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts &amp;c. theſe are but few, and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in compariſon of thoſe that ſubmitte vnto a head, and ſupreme authority. And I shall shew that both they and all others beſide the Romane Church are falſe Churches, for that they ſtande diſobedient to him, and to the paſtors of his Communion, who is indeede the true head of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I haue shewed before that the gouernment which Chriſt inſtituted in his Church was by S. Peter as the head, and cheife paſtour of it. Now I shew that that ſupreme authority of S. Peter was acknowledged by the primitiue Church, to deſcende vpon the bishop of Rome as ſucceſſour to him; and that there is none but he, that can with reaſon pretende to haue had that authority. This is prooued firſt by the manifeſt teſtimonys
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98706:132"/>of thoſe auncient writers that then liued. Secondly by the practiſe of thoſe times; for that the bishop of Rome exercized in fact that ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the faithfull of thoſe times obeyed it. Thirdly for that there is none els, that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to haue bene at any time aboue all other bishops, as the cheife paſtour and gouernour of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then I produce ſoe many,
<note place="margin">The Bishop of Rome is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the primitiue fathers to be the head of the Church.</note> and ſuch teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys of auncient writers, as shall be ſufficient to ſatisfy him that regardeth the ſafety of his ſoule. And to beginne euen from the Apoſtles times; the ſcriptures which they wrote declare ſoe farre for the ſupremacy of the bishops of Rome that they are alleadged to that purpoſe by holy and auncient authors, as will appeare by their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing citations; who ſeeing the ſupreme paſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to haue bene promiſed by Chriſt vnto S.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98706:137"/>was firſt of all giuen to Patriarks and more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſtors, and higher dignitys; it was decreed by an aſſembly of more then ſifty bithops, aboue a thouſand yeares ſinne, that it should be giuen to none, but to the bishop of Rome, as to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal Father of all faithfull chriſtians. Bishops, Emperours, Princes haue obeyed this decree, the cuſtome of nations hath conſented vnto it: and the very enemys of the Catholike Church, now after the praeſcription of a thouſand yeares, giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that honorable title, vertually confeſſe the ſupreme authority which then he had. The bishops of Rome exerciſed authority ouer other dioceſes, and ouer the cheife perſons of the world both of the Clergy and Laity S. Athanaſius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke of Alexandria, (who then tooke place of all but the bishop of Rome) Aſclepas of Gaza, Marcellus of Ancyra, and Lucius of Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis being expelled out of their bishoppricks by thoſe of the Arian faction, repairing to Pope Iulius, were by his authority reſtored to their ſeates againe:

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98706:137"/>by the Pope. Menas Patriarke of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople being thruſt out of his ſeate by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimus an haeretike, (the Emperour fauouring him) appealed to S.

Peter; but he can not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende euer to haue had that ſupreme authority after S. Peter, for the Patriarke of Alexandria was aboue him, although vnder the bishop of Rome. Antioch was indeede the firſt ſeate of S. Peter, the chaire of Alexandria was founded by
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98706:138"/>S. Marke, in S. Peters name, and S. Peter liued at Rome moſt part of the time of his primacy, and dyed there bishop of that place: His ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour muſt be vnderſtoode of his laſt ſeate which he died poſſeſſed of, as all antiquity with good reaſon vnderſtoode it: and therefor although all theſe three in reuerence to S. Peter, were made Patriarchical ſeates; yet Rome was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed allwais as the cheife: it had the firſt place, Alexandria the ſecond, and Antioch but the third. The Patriarke of Conſtantinople cannot pretende to the primacy; for that he was not ſoe much as a Patriarke long after the former, nor for ſome hundreds of yeares after Chriſt; there being noe Conſtantinople before Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; but an obſcure Bythinium of noe ſuch name or note. The Patriarke of Hieruſalem cannot pretende vnto it; for he was vnder the bishop of Caeſarea, as his Metropolitan, and gaue place to all the former. Theſe were the prime of the world in Eccleſiaſticall dignity; and the bishop of Rome was the prime of them, and exercized au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as you haue ſeene ouer them; therefor there is none, but he that can pretende to haue bene the head, and ſupreme paſtour in the Church of Chriſt. To talke of any ſaecular Prince being the head of the Church is not worth mentioning; for he as ſuch hath noe calling to that office. The head of the Church, is the ſucceſſour of S. Peter, who gouerned the Church, as his ſucceſſors alſo did, many yeares after him, vnder heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who could not be the head of the Church of Chriſt. Neither was any Chriſtian Emperour euer
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98706:138"/>permitted ſoe much as to haue a voyce in General Councels. Out of all which hath here bene ſaid it doth appeare ſoe manifeſtly, that at firſt the ſupreme authority ouer the Church of Chriſt was acknowledged to reſide in the Bishops of Rome, as the ſucceſſors of S. Peter, that to deny it is to deny any thinge of antiquity, and to confounde all traditions of writings and of thinges paſt. And hence it followeth that the primitiue Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the ſupreme authority ouer the Church to deſcende, by the inſtitution of Chriſt, vpon the bishops of Rome, as vpon the ſucceſſors of S. Peter, we ought to acknowledge the ſame, and that that bishop hath the prime authority, and that he, and the paſtors that ioyne with him haue the whole lawfull authority of the true Church. And therefor all thoſe Churches that haue begunne at any time in diſobedience to that authority, and continue ſtill diſobedient to it were then, and are ſtill falſe Churches; for that they haue the Marke which we haue aſſigned of diſobedience to the head, and paſtors of the Church, and which S. Cyprian hath giuen of deſpiſing that one iudge, and prieſt, that is for the time the Vicar of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is not now much needfull to examine the beginnings of other Churches and to shew them to haue begunne in diſobedience to the bishop of Rome and his paſtors; becauſe that hauing bene the gouernment of the primitiue Church, the reſt muſt at ſome time haue gone forth of it. Yet for more cleerneſſe and ſatisfaction of all, I will ſay ſomethinge of the particular beginnings either
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98706:139"/>of all or of the more notable ſects that are now extant; to shew how and when they went out of the Romane Church. Firſt the Arians, who are the auncienteſt of all thoſe that are now extant, beganne in the diſobedience of Arius a Prieſt of Alexandria about three hundred yeares after the firſt eſtablishing of the faith of Chriſt: who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating himſelfe from the head and paſtors that then were (to wit of S. Sylueſter Pope, and the fathers of the Councell of Nyce who were ioyned in Communion with him) beganne a new Church without ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of head and paſtors from Chriſt. The Neſtorian Church beganne in the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Neſtorius bishop of Conſtantinople, aboue foure hundred yeares after the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of the Church of Chriſt, who ſeparating himſelfe from the head, and paſtors that then were (to wit from S. Celeſtine Pope and the fathers of the Epheſin Councell in Communion with him) beganne a new Church which had noe ſucceſſion of head and paſtors from Chriſt. The ſeueral Churches of the Graecians and eaſterne people beganne firſt in the diſobedience of Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius aboue eight hundreds yeares after that the faith of Chriſt was receiued by the world: who hauing inuaded and vſurped the chaire of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, was by the authority of Pope Adrian, and of the Councell of Conſtantinople depoſed, and Ignatius whom he had thruſt out was againe reſtored. But Photius raiſing new diſſentions, and ſeditions in the Church of God, drew the Graecians from their dew obedience to the head and paſtors of the Church; and ſoe beganne diuerſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98706:139"/>ſchiſmaticall Churches; ſeuerall bishops aſſuming to themſelues abſolute authority and ſubmitting to none, mainteined in ſchiſme their owne Churches, which had noe ſucceſſion of head and paſtors from Chriſt, except they were as all falſe Churches are of a ſucceſſion inuiſible. The Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes beganne in the diſobedience of Iohn Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, an ignorant lay man in the city of Lyons, aboue eleauen hundred yeares after that the faith of Chriſt had flourished in the world: who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying the authority of Alexander 3. Pope and of the fathers of a General Councell held at Rome, beganne a new Church againſt all, ſaying <hi>we muſt obey God rather then men.</hi> And Iohn Hus was proceeded againſt as an haeretike for mainteining with obſtinacy his doctrine. The Church of the Lutherans beganne in the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Martin Luther, a Fryar of the holy order of S. Auguſtine, about fifteene hundred yeares after the firſt eſtablishing of the Church of Chriſt: who diſobeying the authority of the head and paſtors of the Church that then were, to wit of Pope Leo, and the paſtors of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, broke his vowes of pouerty, chaſtity, and obedience; and hauing gotten ſome to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, he beganne with them a new Church, which had noe ſucceſſion of head and paſtors from Chriſt, nor from any Church; except it were a ſucceſſion inuiſible. The Zinglians beganne in the diſobedience of Vlricus Zuinglius a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Conſtance: who ſeeing the people of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many ſoe greedily to ſwallow downe the liberty of Luthers doctrine and noueltys, diſobeying
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98706:140"/>the authority of Pope Clement, and of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Communion, would beginne alſo a new Church contrary both to the Church of Rome, and of Luther; denying the reall preſence of the body of our Lord in the holy Euchariſt. The Church of the Caluiniſts beganne in the diſobedience of Iohn Caluin Prieſt of Noyon: who following the example of Luther and Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, brokeforth after them out of the sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of Chriſt, and diſobeying the authority of Paulus 3. then Bishop of Rome, and of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Communion, beganne a new Church according to his owne words <hi>ſeparating themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues from the whole world.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reſp. ad verſip.</note> The Church of England which is the neweſt of them all, beganne in the diſobedience of king Henry the eight; who hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt obtained of Pope Leo the glorious title of <hi>Defendour of the faith</hi> for his good ſeruice done to the Church of God, eſpecially in oppugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Luthers hereſy, became afterwards ſoe blinded with carnality, that deſiring of Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a diuorcement from his lawfull wife, and not obtaining it, he denyed his authority, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badde in his dominions all commerce with the court of Rome, and cauſed himſelfe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>The ſupreme head of the English Church vpon earth;</hi> putting to death Bishop Fisher, Sr Thomas Moore and others, for denying his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. By all which it appeareth that the words of S. Iohn may well be applyed to all theſe ſects when to diſcouer the falſe Churches of ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks and heretiks, which he ſpeaketh of by the name of Antichriſt, he giueth them this marke,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98706:140"/>

                  <p>You haue ſeene now the ſupreme authority of the Bishop of Rome to haue bene firſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and obeyed by the primitiue Church; and conſequently all other Churches of chriſtians whatſoeuer, without naming of any, haue at ſome time goneforth of that Church, and begunne in diſobedience to that Bishop, and to the paſtors of his Communion: and you haue ſeene alſo in particular the cheife, and moſt notable (and one may ſay all other Churches: for that the reſt of the petty ſects haue begunne indiſobedience to ſome of theſe and goneforth of them) you haue ſeene I ſay in particular the reſt of the Churches that now are to haue begunne in diſobedience to that authority, which was firſt obeyed by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church of Chriſt, and was then obeyed in the world, and euen by themſelues vntill they tooke vpon them to diſobey it. Wherefor I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this, that the true Church is that which continueth allwais obedient to the true head of the Church, and paſtors of his Communion, and they are all falſe Churches that haue begunne in diſobedience to the true head of the Church and paſtors of his Communion: but there is none
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98706:141"/>but the bishop of Rome that can with any reaſon pretende to be the true head of the Church, nor any paſtors that can pretende to be in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the true head of the Church, but thoſe that are in Communion with him; therefore that is the true Church which hath continued all wais in obedience to the Bishop of Rome and his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and they are all falſe Churches, that haue begunne at any time, and continue ſtill in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to him and them. There remaineth now onely to ſee what they can ſay for themſelues, and to shew the vanity of their pretences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt if they deny that the Romane Bishop had ſupreme authority in the primitiue Church, it is to confound, as I haue ſaid, the knowledge of all thinges paſt. I haue shewed that the holy fathers of thoſe times haue interpreted the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the Bishop of Rome his ſupremacy, and I haue shewed by their plane ſentences, and expreſſe words, <hi>that the Romane Church hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from our Lord and Sauiour himſelfe, the principality and eminency of power ouer all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; that holy ſeate being the hinge and head of all Churches, that in all controuerſys we ought to haue recourſe vnto it, that the Bishop of Rome is the higheſt Prieſt, and Bishop of bishops, that all ſchiſmes and hereſys haue ſprung from the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that chaire, that they are Schiſmatiks and Praeuaricators that ſet vp another chaire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, that they belong to Antichriſt that are not of that Communion.</hi> I haue shewed alſo that the Bishop of Rome his ſupremacy was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Generall Councels, that his legates

And therfor it is moſt ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to deny his ſupremacy which the world hath ſoe long confeſſed. And if they shall ſtill oppoſe it,

                     <hi>the round world shall fight</hi> with him <hi>againſt the ſenſleſſe,</hi> who are ſoe bold, as to hazard their ſoules againſt the whole world, and againſt ſoe many worlds, as I haue shewed gathered together in General Councels, who haue ſubmitted to the Bishop of Rome, as to their ſupreme paſtour.</p>
                  <p>They will grant then perhaps that the Bishop of Rome was once the head of the Church, and that he and his paſtors had the authority of the whole Church; but will ſay, that he and they were fallen into errors; and therfor they were bounde to diſobey them. But this is not a good anſwere: for it is authority which now we inquire after, and which we require obedience vnto. All doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes muſt be tryed by lawfull authority; but law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority muſt not be queſtioned in doctrine; for that there is none to queſtion it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſubiects to examine the authority of the Church, and the doctrine which it teacheth is to ſet the feete aboue the head, and to ſubuert all order, and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church of God.

Neither is there any thinge by which haeretiks diſcouer, and condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more, then by talking of errors in the Church; for by that one sheweth, that he hath ſomethinge to ſay againſt the doctrine of the Church; which is to be an haeretike. The head of the Church and paſtors of his Communion haue the authority of the whole Church, and can not teach falſe doctrine: for if they could we should haue noe certainty of the ſcriptures, or of the ſenſe of them, or of the Creede, or of any point of faith, and this article were in vaine when we ſay <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church.</hi> Which being made by the Apoſtles, to be ſaid at all times; the Church can neuer teach falſe doctrine; but in all doctrines whatſoeuer, and in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſys we muſt cleaue to the authority of the Church, as to a firme, and ſure rocke, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais ſay <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church.</hi>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98706:142"/>what paſtors deliuered their doctrine to them by continual ſucceſſion from Chriſt, and from S. Peter? This they muſt shew, or els they open a gappe to all haeretiks, to diſobey the Church when they will themſelues, vnder pretence of falſe doctrine.</p>
                  <p>If they ſay they haue authority from an inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible head, and inuiſible paſtors, it is a ridiculous ſaying. As though a company of ſouldiers who were brought before a Councell of warre for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting their colours should pretende licence from inuiſible officers: or as rebels, who being accuſed for reſiſting of lawfull authority, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende a commiſſion for what they did; and being required to shew it, should ſay that it were inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; ſoe we aske them vpon what authority they diſobeyed, that authority which the primitiue Church obeyed? and they ſay by the authority of a Church inuiſible. We bid them shew their commiſſion; they ſay it is inuiſible. Is not this Ridiculous? for this it is enough to ſay that men are men, that is to ſay a corporal, and viſible creature; and therefor if the Church which gaue them authority were a congregation of men, it was viſible: and if it were the true Church it was moſt eminently viſible; as a candle not hidden, but ſet in a glorious candleſticke that all might ſee it, and ſee by it, what they were to beleeue for true: and as a city on a hill conſpicuous to all, teaching, preaching, adminiſtring ſacraments, and gouerning of people after a glorious, and eminent manner, that all might haue recourſe vnto it. To alleadge onely an inuiſible authority
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98706:143"/>is to shew noe authority; and shewing noe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they are noe true Church.</p>
                  <p>If they ſay that they diſobeyed not, and went not out from the Communion of the Bishop of Rome and his paſtors; but were thruſten out of it whether they would or noe, (as a later authour who would ſeeme wiſer then the reſt hath vrged) it is the weakeſt of all anſweres. For if they had kept themſelues in obedience to their lawfull gouernors, as they ought they could neuer haue bene out of the Communion of the Church. They were thruſten out of the Church of Rome, as Ozias king of Iuda was thruſten out of the holy temple of Hieruſalem, a plague of leproſy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſuddainly in his forehead in punishment of his pride and diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the high Prieſt and prieſts that were with him; ſoe they obſtinatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying the head and paſtors of the Church that then were, departed of their owne accord from the inward Communion of the Church, and were thruſten out onely from externall Communion with it, leaſt they should infect others with the plague of hereſy, or ſchiſme which appeared in them.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therfor all theſe anſweres to be vaine and groundleſſe, and that they can shew noe head; and paſtors in all the world, that gaue them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to teach their doctrine in diſobedience to thoſe, whom the primitiue Church obeyed; they will pretende authority not by ſucceſſion of paſtors from paſtors which is the ordinary way; but after an extraordinary manner, immediatly from God himſelfe, to diſobey the firſt, and to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98706:143"/>beginne a new gouernment contrary to it; and hauing for this an extraordinary calling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion immediatly from God, they needed noe authority from any paſtors vpon earth; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor they will act according to their commiſſion, and will be tryed by none, nor be ſubiect to any but God. This is the onely anſwere which an hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike can make; who reiecting indeede the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of all men that then are, muſt of neceſſity pretende a particular, and extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion immediatly from God. But neither is this a good anſwere. Firſt for that there can be noe ſuch extraordinary commiſſion, as to diſobey the lawfull authority of the Church of Chriſt; it being builded vpon ſure promiſes of his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall aſſiſtance, that it can not faile in doctrine; but hauing ordained paſtors for the gouernment of it, he will haue them allwais to be obeyed; and therefor that Church that hath not allwais a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſucceſſion of lawfull paſtors, is not the Church of Chriſt. Secondly if they haue any ſuch commiſſion from God, they muſt shew it; or els they open a gappe for all diſobedient perſons to runne out of the Church diſobeying their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſtors when they liſt themſelues, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of commiſſion from God. And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion not comming to them after the ordinary manner from paſtors to paſtors, but after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſort, immediatly, as they pretende, from God himſelfe; they haue noe ordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to shew it, but muſt prooue it by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fignes, and miracles, ſuch as are propper to God onely, and proportionable to that kind
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98706:144"/>of commiſſion. Soe did Moyſes prooue by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that he was ſent of God: ſoe did Chriſt prooue his authority by miracles. But if they haue neither miracles to prooue extraordinary, nor ſucceſſion of lawfull paſtors for ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but vpon their owne bare word onely will draw men from obedience to their lawfull paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, we muſt take them for ſuch as Core, Dathan, and Abiron were; who diſobeying their paſtors, and hauing noe commiſſion from God to shew for it, they and their followers ſunke downe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly into hell. Now for miracles to iuſtify their diſobedience to the Church, they neither haue, nor can poſſibly haue; for that God will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue of any ſuch diſobedience; but hauing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the gouernment of the Church to be by S.

All which I mention in relation to the Apoſtles words; and to my firſt propoſition that there haue bene falſe Churches in the world: and withall to obſerue what abſurde errors men would runne into, if there were not at all times an authority of viſible paſtors guided by the Holy Ghoſt to gouerne the Church, and all were bounde to be gouerned by them. Now if any of theſe were a falſe Church it was for their obſtinacy in thoſe errors, and for their diſobedience to thoſe paſtors which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church acknowledged to haue by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from S. Peter the ſupreme authority, and to the paſtors of their Communion, as hauing at all times the lawfull authority of the whole Church. And theſe were as I haue shewed the Bishops of Rome, and the paſtors that were in Communion with them: none els hauing any pretence vnto that ſucceſſion. Then for the ſecond propoſition, I aske any one of thoſe ſects that are now out of the Catholike Romane Church, what pretence can they haue which is not common to all the reſt, and which all the falſe Churches that are or euer were, and which they confeſſe to be falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches might not, if they would, haue alleadged for themſelues as well as they, to excuſe there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience? If they pretende errors in the doctrine
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98706:145"/>of their paſtors, or if they alleadge priuate ſpirit, or if they pretende authority from the true Church but inuiſible, or if they ſay that they were thruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of the Church againſt their wills, or if they pretende immediat commiſſion from God to diſobey all authority vpon earth in religion; who doth not ſee that all theſe are but vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences common to all that will vſe them, and which if they were to be allowed of, a gappe were opened for all turbulent, and diſobedient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to runne out of the Church vnder ſome of theſe pretences at any time when they would themſelues. Neither is there any thinge which any of them can pretende; but that which all the reſt may as well take for pretence, and all the falſe Churches that euer were whom they confeſſe to be falſe Churches may as well pretende as they. And if this be not ſoe, I deſire, and challenge any wiſe and learned man, of whatſoeuer ſect out of the Romane Church, to ſtudy and to thinke with himſelfe of any lawfull pretence, and excuſe for their diſobedience to the Romane Church, and then to take ſome other which he holdeth to be a falſe Church, and conferring them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to propoſe to his owne conſcience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that pretence agree not as well to the other, as to his owne. And if he can deuiſe none which is propper to his owne Church more then to falſe Churches, then I warne and charge him to returne againe to the obedience of that authority which the primitiue Church firſt obeyed, and which the Romane Church hath allwais obeyed, and which his Church and all others haue at ſome time
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98706:146"/>goneforth of and diſobeyed: and this was as I haue shewed the authority of the bishop of Rome and his paſtors.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98706:149"/>himſelfe diſputed with the Saducaeans about this point, and confirmed in fact the truth of it, when he raized Lazarus to life: who although he had bene fower dayes dead, and laid then ſtinking in the monument; yet when Chriſt called, he heard,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Io.</hi> 11.</note> and obeyed, comming forth fresh and liuely. Holy Iob in the midſt of all his aſſictions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himſelfe with theſe words.

                  <hi>I know that my redeemer liueth, and in the laſt day I shall rize out of the earth.

               <p>Our ſoules and bodys deſiring by nature to be vnited together for the complete and intire conſtituting of man, it ſtands with reaſon that they should once come together againe, that the ſoules of the bleſſed may enioy their deſire and be ſatiated in the naturall appetite which they haue vnto their bodys. And for this reaſon the immortality of the ſoule, and the reſurrection of the body is mentioned in the ſcriptures, and was taken by the auncient Philoſophers, as it were for the ſame: becauſe ſuch is the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that by the immortality of the ſoule the reſurrection of the body is inſerred; for if the ſoule be immortal, and haue a natural appetite to the body, as being ereated to conſtitute man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of both ſoule and body; then that appetite muſt once be ſatiated by the reſurrection of the body after death, and revnion of the ſoule to it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98706:150"/>againe: and ſoe take away the reſurrection of the body, and you take away the immortality of the ſoule, and then all grounds of faith and the hopes of future life are taken away with it; our ſoules being mortal with our bodys: and therefor S. Paul, <hi>If I fought with beaſts at Epheſus what doth it profit mee,</hi>

               <p>That which we beleeue by this article is, that the very ſame bodys which liued before, although neuer ſoe much corrupted shall be vnited to their ſoules againe, and remaine for euer with them, (for if it were not the ſame body which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it were not a reſurrection, but a production of a new thinge) and that this reſurrection is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to all,

               <p>Now to ſpeake of the greatnes of this glory I know not how to beginne: for it is neither in the tongue of man to ſpeake, nor in his hart to thinke the liberality of God in rewarding of his friends. The Saints are then vnited in perfect friendshipp with him, and are receiued into his innermoſt tabernacles, where they shall neuer feare to looſe his grace, nor their place of glory. And by that neere and intimate vnion with God, the diuine power, wiſdome, and goodnes appeareth ſoe reſplendently in them: that euen as iron when it is redd hott ſeemeth to be all fire, by the fire
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98706:152"/>which it conteineth; ſoe the ſaints by that bright glory and ſublime light, by which God dwelleth in them, and ioyneth himſelfe to them, ſeeme to haue put on the very nature of God. It ought to be a great comfort in the way of vertue, and an encouragement to vndergoe labors for Gods ſake, to thinke of the reward which we shall haue in the end. Dauid a yong man comming into king Sauls campe, to viſit his brethren that were ſouldiers in it, ſaw the huge army of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys ouer againſt them, and a mighty gyant ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the midſt of both, formidably armed, challenging all Iſraël to a ſingle duell with him; and although he ſaw all the Iſraëlits to fly from his face forvery feare, yet hearing by chance of a great reward which was promiſed to any that should kill him; to wit that he should haue the Kings daughter to wife, and other things. He hearkened after it, and when he had informed himſelfe well, and vnderſtoode that ſuch was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the kings promiſe, his ſpirits were raiſed with the hopes of reward, and his hart was on fire to be in hand with the gyant: and allthough he knew neither how to weare armour, nor manage armes, but without either ſword, or ſpeare, or any defence for himſelfe, was to venture his life with an old tryed ſouldier, he feared nothing but went downe vnto him as though it had bene to beate a dogge, and ſeeing his enemy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch he ranne towards him threw a ſtone onely in his face, and cloſing preſently with him, with his owne ſword he cut of his head. Soe in our ſpirituall combats the rewarde which we shall haue after
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98706:152"/>victory ought to be a great encouragement vnto vs. We shall haue the grace of God which is the kings eldeſt daughter, and by it euerlaſting glory in the kingdome of heauen. Remember then that thou art the ſouldier of God, and in all temptations thinke that he then calleth thee forth to fight for him in his owne preſence and before the hoſt of his Angells and Saints; and that in the ſight of them all and in their hearing, he had made the promiſe of thy reward: and beſides that he will ſoe helpe thee that thou art ſure of victory if thou wilt.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98706:153"/>holy Hierome for his opinion in it, when I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne the exordium of my ſalutation, behold a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine light, ſuch as our times hath not ſeene, nor can be ſpoken with our tongues, entred into my cell, and filled it with an vnſpeakeable ſweetnes of all odours. Which when I ſaw, I was ſoe aſtoniſhed, that the powers of my minde and body were quite taken from mee. For J knew not then that the right hand of God had exalted his ſeruant.</hi> (Becauſe at that very hower did S. Hierome depart this world) <hi>And therefor becauſe mine eyes had neuer ſeene the like brightnes nor euer had I felt ſuch ſweetnes, I wondered and was quite rauished with it. And being in this ſort I heard a voyce comming forth of that light ſaying to mee, Auguſtine what doſt thou meane? doſt thou thinke to put the ſea into a litle dish? to hold all the earth in the compaſſe of thy hand? to detaine the heauens from their naturall courſe? shall thy eye ſee that which none could ſee? shall thy eares heare more then the eares of any? and thoſe things which haue not entred into any hart doſt thou thinke to conceiue them? where is the end of that which is endles? how wilt thou meaſure that which is immenſe? The ſea shall be put into a litle dish, the earth shall become a handfull, and the heauens shall ſooner ſtay their courſe, then thou shalt vnderſtande the leaſt part of that ioy and glory, which the bleſſed enioy. But that thou shouldſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that which I know now by experience not to vndertake impoſſible things. Seeke not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, but labour to gett that glory which thou wouldeſt conceiue.</hi> Thus S. Hierome would preuent his letter, and ſatisfy him by experience in that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98706:153"/>which he deſired to vnderſtande; to wit that the glory of the Saints is aboue humane vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is enough for vs to thinke that it is a life in which God is enioyed for euer; but here we can not comprehende what <hi>God</hi> is, what <hi>euer</hi> is, or what that <hi>life</hi> is in which God is enioyed, and which they lead in heauen. O the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God! O eternity! O ſweet life in which that infinite good is eternally enioyed! That which is good and the beſt in euery thinge that is conteined in God, the ſumme and hight of perfection. I ſay all in this word <hi>Perfection.</hi> And this perfection thou shalt allwais deſire,

               <head>OF THE EFFECTS OF THE Sacraments.</head>
               <p>THE prime and propper effect of euery Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is to cauſe grace: for they are not onely ſignes to ſignify that God then giueth grace; but they haue power giuen them of God to cauſe grace in the ſoules of thoſe that worthily receiue them: that as a Cherry tree produceth a cherry, and a Plumtree a plumme; ſoe the Sacraments of Chriſt produce grace, as their propper fruit, in the ſoules of the worthy receiuers of them, God vſing them as inſtruments to our ſanctification.</p>
               <p>This is the difference betwixt the Sacraments which were before Chriſt both in the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of Moyſes, and the Sacraments which now we haue in the law of grace, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were before the comming af Chriſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98706:155"/>could not giue grace to ſaluation, but onely fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed the grace, which was to be giuen by our Sacraments; becauſe they ſignifyed him onely who as then was to come and had not purchaſed grace by his paſſion, as yet ſuffered: and ſoe they onely ſignifyed that grace which he was to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and which was to be giuen by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt: by the merits of whoſe paſſion God then gaue grace to thoſe that receiued the former Sacraments; but the Sacraments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as they were of thoſe lawes and times, had not that power; and therfor the Apoſtle calleth them <hi>weake and poore elements:</hi> that is in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vertue and efficacy of our Sacraments;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</note> which as they are the Sacraments of the law of Chriſt haue this preeminence aboue them, that they can cauſe grace in vs.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is grace?</hi> Anſw. <hi>Grace is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural gift, which maketh vs gratfull, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grace is a certaine ſupernatural quality which God infuſeth into our ſoules, by which they are ſanctifyed, and ſoe adorned and beautifyed in his ſight that he cannot but loue thoſe that haue it, and can loue none that haue it not. It is as though a king should beſtow ſome gift vpon euery one of his freinds in token of friendship; which gift should ſoe endeere them vnto him, that they were ſure of his fauour as long as they kept it, and to looſe his fauour if they loſt it: ſoe that this token should both deſtinguish them from his
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98706:155"/>enemys, and alſo cauſe them to be his friends. Such a gift is the grace of the Sacraments; it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally cauſeth vs to be the freinds of God, and deſtinguisheth vs from his enemys.</p>
               <p>All the gifts of God may be called graces in a large ſenſe, as they are gifts which of meere grace, and beneuolence he beſtoweth on his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and ſoe the gift of tongues, of prophecy, of miraculous cures, and the like are commonly called graces: but they are not the grace of the Sacraments, which maketh vs gratfull to God. For although thoſe gifts or graces for the moſt part be giuen to the good; yet ſometimes they are giuen to euill men; as the gift of prophecy was giuen to Balaam an idolatour, and to Caiphas, euen then to prophecy, when he was ſitting in iudgment againſt Chriſt: but none but the iuſt haue Sacramental grace; becauſe it ſanctifyeth all thoſe that haue it. Secondly the good motions and holy inſpirations, by which God moueth vs to good works are called grace; but they are not the grace of the Sacraments, which ſanctifyeth vs; they being often and for the moſt part (God knows) reiected by many, that anſwere not to them. Thirdly the general concourſe of God, by which he preſerueth all creatures in their being, and concurreth with them in their works, is called grace, as when we ſay <hi>by the grace of God I will doe this or that:</hi> that is to ſay with the diuine helpe and concurrence. And in fine all the good which we haue may be called grace, as it proceedeth of the gracious goodnes of God towards vs. But the grace which is cauſed by the Sacraments ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth

And God to shew this power and dignity of out Sacraments, would haue all that ſolemnity in the baptiſme of Chriſt, that the heauens should open, and the whole B. Trinity should ſenſibly appeare.

               <p>GOD hauing ordained man for a glorious future life, by duely worshipping him in this; and directing him in his worship, not by leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery man to himſelfe, independant of all authority, and ſubiect to none; but by ſubiecting him to the obedience of a continual Church, and of ſpiritual paſtors in ſpirituall thinges; it was neceſſary that he should ordaine ſome external and corporal meanes of ſanctification in the Church, that all might vnite and combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the true worship of God by them; which by onely internal and ſpiritual acts could not be; becauſe we vnderſtande not but by outward words and ſignes.

               <head>OF THE MATTER AND FORME of the Sacraments, and of the intention of him that adminiſtreth them.</head>
               <p>BY that which hitherto hath bene ſaid of the Sacraments it appeareth, that they are the medicines of our ſoules, which through the merits of Chriſts Paſſion giue health vnto ſinners. Now medicines as ſuch include and require three things. Firſt the thinge it ſelfe which is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. Secondly the application of it, that it be applyed. Thirdly that it be rightly applyed. That which in the Sacraments is as the medicine it ſelfe is the matter of the Sacraments; that is ſo methinge which in euery Sacrament is applyed: as water in baptiſme, oile in Confirmation &amp;c. That which
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98706:157"/>in the Sacraments is as the application of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, is the forme of the Sacraments; as the words in Baptiſme, Confirmation &amp;c. Becauſe by them the matter or medicine it ſelfe is applyed to the patient. That which is required as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the due and right application of it, is the intention of him that adminiſtreth it: to wit that he intende to apply it as a Sacrament and remedy for ſinne. And if any of theſe three things be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either the matter, the forme, or the right intention of the miniſter, it is noe Sacrament. The matter and forme are required as the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts, which Chriſt ordained for euery Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to conſiſt of: the intention of the miniſter is noe part of the Sacrament; yet it is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſtance neceſſary to it: becauſe thoſe things which are indifferent vnto ſeueral ends muſt be determined by the intention to the end which they are intended for. A charitable and liberal gentleman, ſeeing a company of poore folkes at his doores, throweth them his purſe, and biddeth them take it: they goe away giuing many thanks; and bleſſing God and him, they take it as an almes to vſe as their owne. The ſame gentleman throweth his purſe to his ſteward and biddeth him take it, meaning to lay vp: he taketh it without thanks giuing: becauſe it was not meant him as his owne, nor giuen him as a gift. Now what maketh the firſt to be a gift, and not the ſecond, but the intention of the giuer? who though he did the ſame thinge, and ſaid the ſame words to both; yet the purſe in one caſe onely was beſtowed, becauſe ſoe intended. Soe in the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98706:158"/>Sacraments, the matter and forme may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to diuerſe ends. One may doe all that is to be done, and ſay the words of baptiſme to shew another how to baptize, or ouer an Infidel in ieſt onely and prophane mirth; and then there is noe baptiſme; becauſe his intention was then to teach another, or to be merry, but not to baptize. It is recorded of S. Athanaſius that being a child as he was playing amongſt the children of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels he baptized them as he had ſeene amongſt chriſtians. And it was founde to be true baptiſme; becauſe vpon due examination after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it appeared, that he then intended to giue true chriſtian baptiſme: but if Athanaſius had baptized in ſport onely, it had bene noe baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; becauſe he had not had that intention which God then inſpired him to haue, and which was neceſſary for the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The effect of the Sacraments dependeth not vpon the holines and goodnes of the miniſter, nor requireth any more goodnes in him, then the goodnes, that is the trueneſſe, of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but as a lame and diſeaſed phyſitian may adminiſter good phyſicke to his patient, and to good effect; ſoe an euill miniſter may miniſtrate good Sacraments and to good effect, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer be rightly diſpoſed for it.

For as wine or beere is noe better, nor worſe for being drunke out of a ſyluar bowle then out of an earthen pott, and as the phyſitian giueth noe power to his medicins, but onely applyeth them with that power which they haue of God; and therefor the moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the phyſitian auaileth nothing to the effect of the medicine; ſoe the effect of the Sacraments dependeth not on the goodnes of the miniſter; becauſe he is but the inſtrument of Chriſt, who acteth by him.

               <p>THE Councel of Trent hath declared, that beſides the effect of grace which all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments giue, ſome of them imprint a certaine character, or marke vpon the ſoules of thoſe that receiue them. Theſe are Baptiſme, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and Orders; becauſe by theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments men are choſen, and deputed to ſome

                  </note> S.

               </p>
               <p>The effect of the character is not to giue grace, but onely to deſtinguish thoſe that are deputed to thoſe offices as I haue ſaid.

               <head>OF THE REVERENCE WITH which we ought to receiue the Sacraments.</head>
               <p>AMongſt all the points of chriſtian doctrine there is none more neceſſary to be perfectly learned, then the doctrine of the Sacraments. The other myſterys of faith we are bounde to know them ſpeculatiuely, ſoe as to beleeue them; but of the Sacraments we are bounde to haue a practical knowledge, to receiue them worthily and with fruit. By this we may conceiue ſome thinge of the reuerence which we owe to them: that as pretious as the blood of Chriſt is, and as auailable as the merits of his Paſſion are to vs, they auaile vs nothing at all, nor can we by any other poſſible meanes receiue the benefit of them, but by the Sacraments. They are the cundits by which his pretious blood is conueyed, and conducted to our ſoules: and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth any Sacrament in mortal ſinne ſtoppeth thoſe cundits with beaſtly ſilth profaneth them, and poyſoneth his ſoule.

                  <hi>they haue not knowne the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</hi> That is to ſay the cheife myſterys of God. Now amongſt all the myſterys of God, the ſeauen Sacraments are ſoe high and eminent, that aboue all others they haue purchaſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the name and title of Sacraments. That which followeth of this is, that it is a moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98706:160"/>ignorance not to vnderſtande them; and that there is noe irreuerence in the worldſoe great, as is the vnworthy receiuing of any Sacrament. Chriſt ſtandeth with the chalice of his Paſſion ready to powre it on thy ſoule, to wash away thy ſinnes; and thou profaneſt that chalice when thou profaneſt any Sacrament by receiuing it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. Thou ſpilleſt on the ground, and willfully treadeſt vnder thy feete the blood of thy Sauiour. The ſonne of God hath prouided in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a remedy for thy weake and dying ſoule, and in ſteede of applying it thou abuſeſt it. If a wiſe and carefull phyſitian should ſend vnto his patient in peril of death ſome very pretious and coſtly medicine, and should aſſure him to ſaue his life and reſtore him his health by it; how ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full should he be at the comming of it? but if this patient should refuſe to take it, and inſteede of taking it, should treade it vnder his feete or throw it to the doggs, how great were the contempt which he shewed of his phyſitian and of his owne life? Mortal ſinne is a deadly ſickneſſe, Chriſt is our phyſitian he ſendeth vs the Sacraments a coſtly remedy to him, and the onely remedy that can, and is ſure to cure vs. He that neglects to receiue the Sacraments neglecteth his owne life; he that receiueth them vnworthily, receiueth them as a dogg that had noe ſoule to be ſaued, and hath noe benefit, but woundeth and poyſoneth his ſoule by the ſacrilege which he committeth. <hi>A man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>making the law of Moyſes fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is a ſinne which ſeareth vp the conſcience and obdurateth the hart againſt God: and for thoſe that are guilty of this ſinne, if they continue any time in it, it is very hard, and muſt be by a very ſpeciall grace of God, if euer they come to true repentance. I shall ſpeake more of this in the Sacraments of Euchariſt and Pennance, which very wicked chriſtians ſome times abuſe to their damnation.</p>
               <p>That we may not looſe the benefit of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, it will helpe vs very much before the receiuing of any of them to conſider well, what it is that we are then going to, and to thinke of the great loue that Chriſt bore to our ſoules, when he was nailed to the Cros, and by the price of his life purchaſed for vs, that the Sacraments should ſanctify and ſaue vs. He loued vs to the end, and euen after his death he would shew by a myſtery how much he loued vs, and how deere the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were to him, permitting his bleſſed ſide to be opened, that blood and water might iſſue out, to ſignify Baptiſme and the Euchariſt, and by them all the other Sacraments, as receiuing then their power from him. Imagine then ô Chriſtian when thou goeſt to any Sacrament, that thou didſt ſee thy Sauiour hanging on the Cros, and his ſide running downe with blood and water; and that he called thee vnto him, to let it fall vpon thy ſoule: with what reuerence wouldeſt

Thomas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the nature and neceſſity of ſeauen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for our ſpiritual life by ſeauen things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded neceſſarily in our corporal life. Firſt our corporal life ſuppoſeth generation: and to this baptiſme is anſwerable; for by it we are generated and haue our firſt ſpiritual being and birth: and therefor S. Paul telleth the Corinthians,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</note> whom he had chriſtened, or cauſed to be chriſtened, that he begott them to Chriſt: and in the ſame ſenſe he calleth Oneſimus the child which he begotte in priſon.
<note place="margin">Phile.</note> Secondly our corporal life includeth growth and increaſe of ſtrength: to this Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:98706:161"/>is anſwerable in our ſpirituall life; for by it we are ſtrengthened in the true faith of Chriſt. Thirdly our corporal life requireth foode for nutriment, and eſpecially bread: to this the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Euchariſt is anſwerable; for by it our ſoules are nourished with ſpirituall vigour and nutriment, euen in the ſimilitude of bread; when we receiue him who is the bread of Angels, as he feedeth them with his glorious ſight and preſence. Fourthly our corparal life requireth medicines for the diſeaſes, and hurts, which we are ſubiect vnto: this is ſupplyed by the Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Chriſt hauing inſtituted it as a remedy for all the ſpirituall hurts and diſeaſes which we incurre after baptiſme. Fiftly our corporal life requireth armes of defence againſt our corporal enemys; and ſoe doe our ſoules, eſpecially at the hower of our death when our enemys rage moſt againſt vs; and for this we haue the Sacrament of Extreme vnction, by which our weake ſenſes are armed againſt the deuils power. Sixtly the corporal life of man, as he is ordained to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of other men, requireth a ſuperiour autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be in ſome, for the gouerning of others; and ſoe an orderly gouernment is neceſſary for vs in the Church of God; and for this we haue the Sacrament of orders in which power is giuen to ſome in ſpiritual things Seauenthly, for the continuance and conſeruation of humane nature, a continuall ſucceſſion, and propagation of mankind is neceſſary in the world; and for this the ſpiritual life of man requireth, that it be done by a Sacrament for the orderly propagation of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98706:162"/>men, and the increaſe of ſoules to the worship of God. This is by the Sacrament of Matrimony: which as it is a duety of nature is onely for corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation; but as it is a Sacrament it giueth grace, for the increaſe of ſoules in the diuine worship.</p>
               <p>The number of the Sacraments shall appeare furthermore out of the ſcriptures in that which I haue to ſay of euery Sacrament in particular. The ſame is declared by diuerſe Councels. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fathers haue had noe occaſion in their writings to name them alltogether; yet they haue made mention of them all, as occaſion ſerued. Neither is it neceſſary that we should aſſigne the time when euery Sacrament in particular was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of Chriſt. We know the times of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ſome of them; and we know that for forcy dayes, betwixt his reſurrection and his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, he frequently appeared vnto his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and taught them many things, which they were to obſerue in the Church, which are not mentioned in the ſcriptures; and we know that the Sacraments of the Church muſt be of Chriſts teaching, and ordaining. We haue for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Sacraments the ſame authority, that we haue for any of the ſcriptures, to wit the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church: which although it declare not the time when the ſcriptures were written; yet it aſſureth vs of all their verity; and ſoe it doth of the number of the Sacraments.
<note place="margin">ad Caſulan.</note> S. Auguſtine giueth vs this rule, that for thoſe thinges which are generally receiued by the Church, if their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings be not knowne, they are to be taken
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98706:162"/>for Apoſtolical traditions: but ſuch is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeauen Sacraments; therefor they are of Apoſtolical tradition.

               <p>Heretiks (that would confounde all things in the Church of God) haue gone about to take away our chriſtendome from vs, affirming quite contrary to the words of Chriſt, that a man not borne of water may enter into the kindome of heauen, pretending that children are ſanctifyed by their parents faith, and therefor will not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them. But this as I haue ſaid is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the words alleadged, and in it ſelfe moſt abſurde, in that it maketh the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to come to children, not by grace, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance from faithfull parents; and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall glory to be obtained by natural and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meanes. Children are not abſolutly holy, in that they come of holy parents: good parents are indeede a meanes to thee ſanctification of their children by procuring for them that which God hath ordained for their ſanctification; but the goodnes of the parent can not merit grace for the child, nor ſanctify him. This muſt be done by applying the merits of Chriſts paſſion to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſome Sacrament.

               <head>OF THE CAEREMONYS OF Baptiſme.</head>
               <p>THE dignity of the Sacraments of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that they be deliuered with deuout, and reuerent caeremonys; ſuch as may both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the nature of them, and moue vs to deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe holy myſterys. Haeretiks when we ſpeake of caeremonys preſently beginne to laugh, and as thoſe that are poſſeſſed with euill ſpirits deride holy things; ſoe doe they the caeremonys of the Catholike Church. But this is the ſpirit of haeretical pride which is in them, proceeding from their owne willfull ignorance, becauſe they will not conſider and vnderſtande truely the nature of caeremonys;
<note place="margin">The original cauſe and grounde of caeremonys.</note> which is to be a corporal worship of God according to our nature, and an humble acknowledgment of our weake and corporal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; who are indeede ſpiritual creatures in our ſoules, but tyed vnto and clogged with a body which is earthly; and therfor we muſt honour. God both with our ſoules and bodys: with our inward affections, as the operations of the ſoule, and with corporal caeremonys as the duety of our bodys; euery creature being to honour him after that manner which is natural to it. Angels honour God onely by affections, which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; becauſe they are onely ſpirits: but man that conſiſteth both of ſoule and of body, muſt worship him both with ſpiritual affections of the ſoule, and with corporal reuerence. It is true, God reſpects moſt the inward of our
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98706:165"/>harts, and without that nothing is acceptable to him; but he will accept of corporal works together with our harts: he will haue vs to pray in ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, yet he refuſeth not our vocal prayers, which are corporal expreſſions of our inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to him. Nay he is ſoe farre from refuſing them, that Chriſt would both practiſe them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and commende them to his Diſciples; giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a forme of vocal prayer. And as God, who reſpects moſt the inward of our harts, would neuertheleſſe allow of and commende vocal prayer; that we might vſe it as an expreſſion na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to vs, to humble our ſelues in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our weake nature; ſoe will he haue vs to expreſſe our inward ſubmiſſion of hart by corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caeremonys, and humble ourſelues by them vnto him.</p>
               <p>This is the original cauſe of vocal prayer and of caeremonys, as kneeling, holding vp our hands and the like at our prayers: and for this cauſe God would haue caeremonys to be vſed in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, both in the law of nature and of Moyſes; and Chriſt would initiate the law of grace with many caeremonys, which himſelfe vſed. Read the fifteenth of Geneſis,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.</note> and you shall finde that God commanded to take for ſacrifices ſuch and ſuch creatures, of ſuch an age, to be diuided after ſuch a manner, and to be laid in ſuch a poſture: all which an haeretike may laugh at, if he will. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the law of Moyſes; he that should reade, with the ſpirit of an haeretike, all thoſe very many and ſtrange caeremonys, which were then vſed,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98706:165"/>blood of a ramme put vpon the tippe of his right eare right thumbe, and right great toe, would perhaps laugh them to ſcorne, although they were ordained of God, as this whole law was; which was ſoe full of caeremonys, that it may well be diuided into the <hi>Caeremonial law.</hi> He that in the ſpirit of an haeretike should reade the ſeauenth of S. Marke,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.</note> and should ſee Chriſt take the deafe and dumbe man out of the multitude, might aske to what purpoſe did he ſoe? could he not as well haue cured him amongſt the people? he putt his ſingars into his eares: to what purpoſe, would this haeretike ſay, could he not haue cured him as well without that caeremony? he ſpitted, touched his tongue, looked vp to heauen, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaid <hi>Epheta.</hi> To what purpoſe, might he ſay, was all this? could not he haue done the miracle as well without it? Yes!
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 18.</note> Chriſt could haue cured him without theſe caeremonys, with a word onely, as he did the blind man with onely <hi>Reſpice:</hi> or without any word at all; but onely the word of his will, as he did the Centurions boy, neither ſpeaking, nor touching, nor ſoe much as ſeeing him, but with his eyes of pitty; being then in body abſent from him. But although then he would vſe noe caeremonys; yet at other times, as you haue ſeene, he did; and for the moſt part he cured by impoſition of hand; and that to very good purpoſe: and if the haeretike will know to what purpoſe it was; it was to teach him, and all men to worship God according to their nature, and to humble themſelues in the conſideration of their corporal nature. Holy Dauid, ſeeing the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98706:166"/>arke of our Lord coming forth of Obededoms houſe, moued with the zeale of diuine worship, deueſted himſelfe of his princely maieſty, and being a king, he thought it noe disparishment to gird himſelfe with a linnen Ephod, and to leape and dance before the arke of our Lord: Michol his foolish wife looking through a window and ſeeing it, deſpiſed him in her hart for that caeremony of deuotion; and when the king came to his houſe she mette him, and vpbraided him with it, as a ſcornefull caeremony. But what was his anſwere to her?
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Before our Lord will I play and will become more vile then J haue bene and I will be humble in mine eyes.</hi> This is the effect of the caeremonys of the Church, to humble vs to God whilſt we reuerence him both in body and ſoule. Dauid was an humble man, and the type of a good Catholike, Michol was a prowde woman, and may ſignify haeretiks; for as she derided Dauids deuotion, ſoe doe haeretiks deride the caeremonys of the Church: but we haue an anſwere for them in Dauids words. I will humble my ſelfe both in ſoule and body to God, and will ſerue him with all my might, ſpiritually and corporally. This is a ſufficient anſwere to all obiections againſt caeremonys.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of caeremonys:
<note place="margin">Two kindes of caeremonys</note> the one hath a direct and immediate relation to God, without repreſenting any particular myſtery, as kneeling at our prayers or to the B. Sacrament, holding vp our hands, adorning of Churches, and the like. The other is of caeremonys which repreſent ſome particular myſtery as the ſigne of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98706:166"/>the Cros, in relation to the Paſſion of Chriſt, and the caeremonys of the maſſe, and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which for the moſt part ſignify ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge of his life or death. By the firſt we humble our ſelues to God in the condition of our nature: the ſame we doe alſo by the ſecond, and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more by them we remember, and honour the myſterys which they repreſent. All the caeremonys of the Church are in the ſame nature as corporal ſacrifices, Sacraments, and vocal prayers; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions of our inward affection. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be any thinge obiected againſt the nature of caeremonys, but it hath the ſame force againſt them.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient for caeremonys in general. Now for the particular caeremonys of baptiſme, we neede but to shew that they haue holy ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.

               <p>This inſtitution of Godfathers was very much to the aduancement of chriſtian piety in all thoſe that were to be baptized, who although they were at yeares of diſcretion, yet as yong chriſtians were to be inſtructed in religion, and deuotion.

It is a thing much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Councell of Trent to giue ſuch ſtrange and exoticall names, as ſome doe to their children. And it is not onely a vaine and prophane thinge outwardly, but alſo iniurious to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren themſelues. The poore infant muſt take that
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98706:169"/>name whether it will or noe for all the life time, and perhaps when it is dead shall then curſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that impoſed it, when it shall goe to hell for want of a patrone, by whoſe aſſiſtance it might haue liued, and dyed in better eſtate.

               <p>Baptiſme being a Sacrament of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when preſent danger of death vrgeth, and noe Prieſt is at hand, it may and muſt be giuen by any of the Clergy, and in abſence of all the clergy by a lay man; and in abſence of a man by a woman. They may giue the eſſence of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; but the caeremonys are not to be attempted vpon by any but by Prieſts. It is good therefor for all, but eſpecially for Midwiues, to know how to baptize in time of neceſſity. They are to powre water vpon the head, or vpon ſome other part of the child, or to dippe ſome part of it into water, and to ſay <hi>I Baptize thee.

               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Bleſſed Sacrament of Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt?</hi> Anſ. <hi>The Bleſſed Sacrament of Euchariſt is the very true body, and blood of our Lord, vnder the ſignes of bread or wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO be the Euchariſt two things are required. The inward ſubſtance, and outward ſignes or ſpecies. The inward ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is the body and blood of our Lord; the outward ſignes or ſpecies is the appearence which it hath of bread or wine. The ſame ſubſtance of Chriſt which is in the Euchariſt is alſo in heauen; but the Euchariſt is not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, becauſe he is not there vnder the ſignes of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98706:170"/>bread or wine. The ſame ſignes of bread and wine are vpon the altare before, as after the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Euchariſt is not there before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe then the ſubſtance of Chriſt is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſignes; but the bread and wine being conſecrated into the body of our Lord, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power of God Chriſt is vnder thoſe ſpecies and it is then the B. Sacrament of Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>This is commonly called the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for that it is eminently bleſſed aboue the reſt of the Sacraments, and infinitly bleſſed in that it conteineth the authour of all bleſſe. Theſe are the words of S. Denis the diſciple of S.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl hier. c.</hi> 3.</note> Paul concerning it, <hi>for it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to our renewmed maſter the Conſummation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither is it almoſt lawfull for any of the prieſtly functions to be exercized, but this diuine and high Sacrament of Euchariſt muſt be performed.</hi> It is the higheſt indeede and moſt diuine of all the Sacraments; becauſe the reſt conteining onely the vertue and power of Chriſt; this truely and really conteineth Chriſt himſelfe. And therefor the Apoſtles called it the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that is to ſay, a high and bleſſed grace or gift. By it the Church of Chriſt is placed in a midle ranke of honour, aboue the ſynagogue of the Iewes, and vnder the cittizens of heauen; we being but a litle leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted then they. The Synagogue of the Iewes in the law of Moyſes had Chriſt in ſigure onely, we in the Euchariſt haue him as really as the cittizens of heauen, but they haue him in glory.</p>
               <p>In the Euchariſt all Chriſt is conteined, for although by vertue of the words, <hi>This is my body
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98706:171"/>&amp;c.</hi> his body onely be really preſent in it; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his perfections are allwais accompanying his ſacred body, and whereſoeuer it is, there is all Chriſt; hence it followeth that both his body and ſoule, and all the perfections of his diuine and humane nature, and all whatſoeuer is in Chriſt, is really in the Euchariſt in company of his body. If his body were without his ſoule then it were dead,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom</hi> 6.</note> as it was in the ſepulcher: but <hi>Chriſt riſing againe from the dead now dieth noe more.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle. Chriſt therfor being now not dead, whereſoeuer his body is, there his ſoule is all ouer vnited to it. There is then his intire humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of body and ſoule; and being that his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and humane nature are allwais vnited together, there is alſo the diuine word and nature of God. All Chriſt is intirely in the hoſt, and all Chriſt is intirely in the chalice, although vnder different ſignes and ſpecies. And Chriſt is not onely all in all the hoſt, and chalice; but all Chriſt is in euery part of them: ſoe that he that receiueth onely the hoſt, receiueth as much as he that receiueth both hoſt and chalice; and he that receiueth the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice onely, receiueth as much as both chalice and hoſt, and the leaſt particle of either of them is as much as all. The reaſon of this, ſuppoſing the truth of Chriſts words, may eaſily be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode; for that he did not determine any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular quantity to be conſecrated: which if he had done, then a leſſer quantity had not bene conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated: but leauing the quantity indifferent, and the leaſt part of it being conſecrated as well as the whole, it is the perfect Euchariſt, and perfect
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98706:171"/>Chriſt, as well as the whole.</p>
               <p>Chriſt being shortly to depart this world, would leaue vnto vs a great teſtimony ef his loue; and although his paſſion and death were ſufficient to teſtify it; yet beſides them he would beſtow a gift, token, and pledge vpon vs; which might all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais remaine with vs as a memorial of him. He called therfor his diſciples to ſupper: and being there all together, he made his wil and laſt teſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment amongſt them; bequething vnto them the moſt pretious, gift, that was in his hands to giue, and in his bleſſed hands were all thinges. It was his owne pretious body which then he bequeathed and gaue to them, and with it all the perfections of his diuine, and humane nature, and he gaue it not in promiſe onely, and for the future: but he deliuered it then to them for themſelues, and for all good chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for euer. And that noe haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike might miſconſtrue his will, and defraude the world of this pretious Isgacy, he declared his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſoe planely and in ſuch termes, as could not wel be miſinterpreted; telling them that it was the very body which Was to be deliuered and that blood which was to be shedd.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98706:172"/>true body and blood was deliuered and shedd, it was his true body and blood which then he gaue to them. And although (as there is noe abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoe great but haeretiks wil finde out how to mainteine it) the Manichees haue conceited, that an apparent body onely, and not the true body of Chriſt was deliuered on the Cros for vs: yet now, that I heare of, there are noe ſuch hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks in the world.

That which he gott for his paines was to haue his doctrine condemned in ſeueral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. But at laſt being touched inwardly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience he recanted. And although he fell into hereſys againe: yet he had ſoe much feeling of the auctority of the Church, and of a General Councel, as that he recanted againe, and (which is very rare in ſuch men) he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repentant vnto his death; and being then affrighted at the thought of his former errors he is recorded to haue confeſſed the horrour of his conſcience ſaying, <hi>for my repentance I hope for

The rodd of Moyſes was tranſubſtantiated, that is conuerted into the ſubſtance of a Serpent. The waters of Aegypt were turned into blood.

What diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is there then, that God who with a word of his power created heauen and earth, and made all things of nothing, should change the ſubſtances of bread and wine into the ſubſtance of his ſacred body, which he would leaue with vs It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle which God would worke; and the fathers of the Catholike Church haue allwaies acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſoe: and that there is here a change of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but if there were onely a change in the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, as the Zuinglians and Caluiniſts ſay; or onely in the real preſence as the Lutherans ſay, then there were noe miraculous change of that which were before; it remaining ſtill there according to them. Neither are thoſe ſimilitudes alleadged to any purpoſe by the fathers, vnles we vnderſtande a change of the former into a new ſubſtance, as there was in them. The Iuy bush before it be hung vp is noe ſigne of wine, and when it is hung vp it becommeth a ſigne; but there is nothing aboue nature in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; becauſe there is a change onely in the ſignification, which then it hath, but not in a new ſubſtance or nature. But the holy fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſome thinge ſupernaturall in this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and compare it with conuerſions of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which were miraculous; therefor there is here a tranſubſtantiation or conuerſion in the ſubſtance.

But Chriſt turning to the twelue and asking them, what will you alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? Then S.

Peter: and Chriſt had ſoe diſpoſed of his ſpeech, as though of purpoſe he had intended to draw this anſwere from him. It was for our inſtruction in this point: that we might ſay as S. Peter ſaid, eſpecially then when we are going to receiue. <hi>Lord wither shall I goe but vnto thee?

And when the prieſt preſenteth the ſacred hoſt to then, and ſaith <hi>Domine non ſum dignus,</hi> &amp;c. Say thou with him <hi>Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldſt enter vnder my roofe; but onely ſay the word and my ſoule shall be ſaued.</hi> And repeate them thrice ouer with him. The humble Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion thought it too great an honour for him to haue Chriſt to come into his houſe to cure his ſeruant; but he entreth into thy body, to cure thy ſoule. Thou hadſt neede to be more humble, and better diſpoſed then he was, although worthy
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98706:178"/>to be commended of Chriſt. When the prieſt de liuereth the bleſſed Sacrament to thee, lift vp thy head that he may ſee what he doth, and hold the towel vnder thy chinn to kepp any particle that might chance to fall: open thy mouth decently, and putting thy tongue to thy lips, receiue that ſacred hoſt, as a pledge of thy redeemers loue: who as he came into this world and refuſed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shame nor paine to make thee his freind, ſoe whould he ſtill humble himſelfe in remaining with thee to keepe thee in his freindship.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as thou haſt receiued, and washed thy mouth, if neede be, with ſome drinke; gather together all the powers of thy ſoule to giue thanks vnto God, doe homage to him with them, and offer them to him to be imployed in his ſeruice all thy life time: loue him with all thy hart, and deteſt all that which is diſpleaſing to him, and neuer faile as often as thou receiueſt to make a vehement deteſtation of that ſinne, which thou art moſt inclined vnto, purpoſing and thinking how to amende it. Vntill thou haſt the benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prieſt, ſitt ſtill on thy knees, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with loue and reuerence to thy ſoueraigne.

               <p>IT is neceſſary that we declare why the people receiue onely vnder one kind, ſeeing that Chriſt inſtituted it vnder both, gaue it to his diſciples vnder both, and commanded them to conſecrate it as he had done; and ſeeing alſo that the people in the primitiue Church receiued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kinds. There are many good reaſons for it, as you shall preſently ſee; but firſt we wil examine what it was that Chriſt commanded at the laſt ſupper for if he commanded that all should receiue vnder both kinden, then all were bounde ſoe to receiue; but if he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande it, then it is indifferent to receiue vnder both, or one kind onely.</p>
               <p>Chriſt at the laſt ſupper commanded his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaying,

                  <hi>doe this for a commemoration of mee.</hi> But it is to be obſerued that he ſaid this after the conſecration of the bread, before he had begunne with the chalice, as both S. Luke, and S. Paul declare; and therefor if he commanded
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98706:179"/>any thinge concerning the kinds of ſpecies in which we were to receiue, it was of the ſpecies of bread that we should receiue in it; and not of the chalice, which as yet he had not begunne with. But the truth is that he commanded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the receiuing vnder one or both kindes; but he left it indifferent according to conuenience of circumſtances, which might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the Church, and ſoe the primitiue Church allwais vnderſtoode it. That which Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles was to conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te as he had done, and that they should giue in ſubſtance that which he gaue, but not that they should giue it with all the ſame circumſtances with which he gaue it to them, as is manifeſt. For he gaue it at ſupper, to twelue onely not the firſt: but the laſt meate of that day. The primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue Church gaue it not after ſupper nor onely to Bishops or prieſts, who are as the Apoſtles, but to the Clergy and Laity, of men, women, and children; and that the firſt meate of the day. Soe that the ſubſtance onely of that which Chriſt then did was commanded by him to be done afterwards; but for all to receiue vnder both kindes belongeth onely to the circumſtances of receiuing it; and therefore it is indifferent. And although the Euchariſt being conſecrated vnder both kindes, it be then neceſſary that in both kindes it should be receiued; yet it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that all should ſoe receiue it. For when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>drinke ye all of this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</note> he ſaid ſoe onely to the Apoſtles, intending to debarre none of them from it. And ſoe if we will vnderſtande his
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98706:180"/>words, <hi>doe this in commemoration of mee</hi> as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande, for receiuing vnder both kindes; it muſt be as a commande to ſome diſtributiuely, but not vnto all the collection or congregation of the Church, taking euery one in particular.

And therfor the Church hath allwais obſerued that at maſſe which is the publike ſeruice of God, and moſt ſpecial repreſentation of the laſt ſupper, the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament should be receiued vnder both kindes, in imitation of Chriſts action, and performance of his will; but that out of maſſe both Prieſts and people should receiue vnder one, or both kindes, according to conuenience of times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.

Secondly many irreuerences would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered of ſpilling the chalice, if all both old and yong, ſicke and lame perſons were bounde to receiue it. Thirdly many haue an auerſion from wine that they can not drinke it. Fourthly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient wine could hardly be gotten for ſoe many and frequent Communions as Catholiks (God be thanked) now vſe. For theſe and the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Chriſt would not binde all to receiue vnder the ſpecies of wine; but would leaue the manner of receiuing to the determination of the Church, according to diuerſity of times and circumſtances. In the primitiue Church the people for the moſt part receiued vnder both formes, it being then neceſſary for the ſetling of the faith of Chriſt that his actions should be more ſtrictly obſerued, allthough it were in things indifferent and with ſome inconuenience. But now that the faith of Chriſt is ſetled in the world, thoſe things which
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98706:181"/>are indifferent; and were with ſome inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce at firſt permitted, are now to be remedied; eſpecially then when the inconueniences grew ſoe great that haeretical ſpirits tooke occaſion to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine falſe doctrines by them: as it happened in this very caſe, when Iacobellus of Prague being offended to ſee ſome of the people to receiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind onely, and ſome vnder both; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it would needs hold all to be bounde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vnder both kindes: which was contrary to the continual doctrine, and practiſe of the Church, and to the reaſons alleadged. To reforme this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour the Councell of Conſtance proceeded againſt it: in which Iacobellus his doctrine was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and for the future it was ordained, that at maſſe as the ſpecial repreſentation of the laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and commemoration of it, the Prieſt should receiue vnder both kindes, both the hoſt and the chalice, and that out of maſſe all should receiue onely the hoſt. Soe all inconueniences were taken away, a decent vniformity was procured in the Church, and the auncient and true doctrine was better vnderſtoode; that it was not of obligation for all to receiue vnder both kindes. For as the Councell of Trent hath obſerued when Chriſt ſaid <hi>vnles you eate the flesh of the ſonne of man and drinke his blood you shall not haue life in you.</hi>

               <p>THE effect of the Euchariſt is to giue grace, by which we become the adopted children of God, nourished and fedd as it were at his owne table, our ſoules hauing ſatiety in him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by it the fullnes of his glory. That where as according to S.

And it is eſpecially gained by this Sacrament, both by reaſon of the more ſpecial vnion which we baue with Chriſt in it; and alſo for that the gift of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance is eſpecially here obtained as by a ſtrong and nourishing bread. It remitteth ſinne and preſerueth from future ſinne, according to the diſpoſition of the receiuer; according to which alſo it blotteth out the punishment due to it. It hath for its propper effect to feede and to ſtrengthen the ſoule, to keepe it in ſpiritual health and vigour. And becauſe for the moſt part it is receiued with more feruour and ſweetnes of deuotion, and outwardly in the ſimilitude of bread; therfor it is compared to the Manna of the Iſraëlits, which is thought by ſome to haue had the ſweetnes of all taſts.

               <head>THE SACRAMENT OF Pennance.</head>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Sacrament of Pennance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Pennance is a Sacrament by which we haue the forgiuneſſe of ſinnes in Confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FIRST we will shew that this is a Sacrament in the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and then we will declare the parts of it, and benefits which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by it. Although Luther for the moſt part denyeth this to be a Sacrament, and laboureth with other Proteſtants, to robb the world of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98706:182"/>benefit of it; yet l. de capt. bab. he ſaith that it is a Sacrament. There he ſaith truely, for it is ſoe indeede, and hath all that is included euen in the Proteſtants definition of a Sacrament Apol. Confeſſ. art. 13. which is to be an outward ſigne inſtituted of Chriſt, by which grace is promiſed. And this it shall appeare to be.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the many apparitions which Chriſt made betwixt his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion to his diſciples, S. Iohn hath recorded that once he came and ſtood in the midſt of them, and ſaid <hi>Peace be to you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Io.</hi> 20.</note> And when he had ſaid this he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them his hands, and ſide, and ſaid againe <hi>Peace be to you. As my father hath ſent mee, I alſo doe ſend you. And he breathed vpon them and ſaid: Receiue ye the Holy Ghoſt: whoſe ſinnes you shall forgiue they are forgiuen them: and whoſe you shall retaine, they are retained.</hi> This is all which the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt mentioneth to haue paſſed in that ſolemne apparition which muſt therfor include ſome great myſtery. Hence it appeareth that this is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for where forgiunes of ſinnes is promiſed, there grace is promiſed. And this forgiuing and retaining of ſinnes being giuen to the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors to be practiſed by them, who vnderſtande not the inward of mens minds and conſciences; the poenitent muſt declare his ſinnes to them, that they may know what, and how to forgiue, or to retaine them. And ſoe there is all that is included in the nature of a Sacrament, to wit an outward ſigne both in the poenitent confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the Prieſt abſoluing, and that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne inſtituted, of Chriſt to giue grace vnto
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98706:183"/>ſanctification. By which the Catholike doctrine is made manifeſt, that power is giuen to the Church to forgiue ſinnes. For is it likely that Chriſt would appeare in all thoſe circumſtances, and myſterious caeremonys giuing them the Holy Ghoſt for nothing but onely, to let them know, that God can and doth forgiue ſinnes. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles eſteemed ſoe highly of this grace; that they made the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes an article of the Creede: to wit by the power of the Catholike Church, which they had profeſſed in the article before. Is it likely that they meant to make it an article of the Creede, that God can and doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue ſinnes? After that, they vnderſtoode that themſelues had power to forgiue ſinnes, they being ſent as Chriſt was ſent, and the Holy Ghoſt being giuen ſoe particularly then to them; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for they feared not to practiſe the forgiuing of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Prieſts of themſelues haue not power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue ſinnes; for noe man of himſelfe hath that power. They haue it of God, as the vicars and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes of him who gaue it them. God giu's power to prieſts as kings doe to iudges: Iudges repreſent the perſon of the king; and Prieſts repreſent the diuine maieſty: Iudges muſt be informed, and ſoe muſt prieſts: iudges giue ſentence, and their ſentences are ratifyed by the king, God giueth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to prieſts and their ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are ratifyed by him: he that contemneth the authority of the iudge contemneth the authority of the king, and he that contemneth the prieſts authority contemneth the diuine maieſty; Chriſt hauing made them his iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98706:183"/>and ſet them in his owne place, with power to binde and to looſe, promiſing that what they did vpon earth should be ratifyed in heauen.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt did truely giue this power to the Church, his words are as plane as words vſe to be: and that plane words might not be miſconſtrued, he deliuered them in ſuch circumſtances, as might binde them, as it were, to that ſenſe. Firſt he told them that he ſent them, as his father had ſent him, who forgaue ſinnes. Then he breathed vpon them, and badd them receiue the Holy Ghoſt: what for? it muſt needs be for ſome great worke, and eminent power. Then he told them what it was for; to wit to forgiue ſinnes. Is not this as plane as can be? Beſides we deſtroy all connexion, and ſenſe in the words of Chriſt, if we will haue him to ſay whoſe ſinnes you shall forgiue, when they could forgiue none at all. He that shall call this power of forgiuing ſinnes, power onely to declare, that God then forgiueth the poenitent his ſinnes, and shall ſay that prieſts doe not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, but onely declare that God then forgiueth, shall ſay nothing to the purpoſe. For although it be true, that prieſts doe not forgiue ſinnes by their owne natural power; but doe declare that God then forgiueth with them; yet they doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly forgiue, and as properly as iudges doe, who hauing commiſſion from the king to punish, or to pardon, are properly ſaid to pardon that crime which the king pardoneth by them. Soe prieſts pardon and forgiue ſinnes by commiſſion and power from God. And he that calleth it power to forgiue calleth it as Chriſt did, and he that will
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98706:184"/>call it onely power to declare, miſcalleth it, and sheweth in himſelfe a contentious and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting minde, in reiecting of thoſe termes which Chriſt and his Church doth vſe.</p>
               <p>To ſay that God can not giue that power to men, for that it were to deueſt himſelfe of his owne power is diſprooued in fact; for that Chriſt euen according to his humanity had, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized that power: and when the Iewes murmured at him for it (as haeretiks doe againſt prieſts) he prooued it by a miracle: as is declared in the tenth article of the Creede. Beſides! what is there that God can not doe? or what impoſſibility is there in the giuing of that power to men? It is a ſupernatural power, noe harder to be giuen then ſupernatural power is for the working of miracles, as for caſting out of deuils, who by nature are farre ſuperiour to vs: yet that power was giuen to the Apoſtles, and they practized it, as their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors alſo doe to good effect. And for God to giue the power of forgiuing ſinnes to men, is not to deueſt himſelfe of it; but it is rather to veſt himſelfe with mercy and iuſtice as becommeth him: mercy in accepting of ſoe ſmall a worke, iuſtice in requiring that worke of vs.</p>
               <p>We will ſee what the fathers of the primitiue Church haue ſaid of this power, and that in their times Confeſſion was practiſed for the remiſſion of ſinnes.

               <p>The eſſential parts of it conſiſt in ſomethinge which is done by the poenitent and ſomethinge by the prieſt. That which is required of the poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is Contrition, Confeſſion, and Satisfaction: which are the matter of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as the acts of him that ſeeketh to be reconeiled to God. For as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation vnto human freindship requireth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe three things in the offender; to wit ſorrow for his falt, acknowledgment of it, and ſatisfaction for it; ſoe doth alſo our reconcilement with God. That which is required on the prieſts part, is to giue abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as the forme of the Sacrament: God vſing humane meanes, when he pardoneth by men.</p>
               <p>This Sacrament doth not allwais take away all punishment due to the ſinnes which were forgiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. For our ſoules hauing bene purged before, and made the temples of God in baptiſme, and we hauing polluted them againe with new ſinnes, we can not in reaſon expect to haue all due punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be taken away by this, as we had by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. God was eſpouſed to vs in the holy font, and when after it we fell into ſinne we baſely adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated and broke our fidelity with him: it is well that he will receiue vs to his fauour againe; we muſt not thinke to haue as much in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we had at firſt in baptiſme: according to the deuotion and diſpoſition which we haue; ſoe is our punishment more or leſſe forgiuen. He that loueth much shall haue much for giuen him.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:98706:185"/>Now let vs ſee how to diſpoſe ourſelues for it. Three things as I haue ſaid are required on the poenitents part. Contrition, Confeſſion and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Firſt,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>OF CONTRITION.</head>
               <p>BY Contrition we may vnderſtande all that which the poenitent is to doe before Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as a preparation to it. He is to examine his conſcience, to be ſorty for his ſinnes, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to amende them: and if any of theſe three things be wanting, the Sacrament is not onely without fruit, but a mortal ſinne is committed. As for examen of conſcience, thoſe that haue abſtained long from confeſſion and haue their ſoules ouergrowne with much filth of ſinne, muſt take more time for it; that through negligence they omitte nothing which is neceſſary to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. Thoſe alſo that come oftener to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and haue onely venial ſinnes to confeſſe ought to be carefull in the examining of their conſciences, the better to diſpoſe themſelues for confeſſion, and to preuent euill cuſtomes, and alſo the better to diſcerne the greeuouſnes of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me which ſee me perhaps but litle ſinnes to them, but are indeede greater then they ſeeme to be.</p>
               <p>For this it wil helpe much, that we gett a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of examining our conſciences euery night before we goe to bedde, calling to minde the ſinnes which we haue commited that day, and noting them downe in our memory, as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in a table booke againſt we goe to confeſſion
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:98706:186"/>The firſt thinge which we are to doe in this nightly examen is to giue thanks vnto God for the benefits of that day. Secondly to deſire grace and light of him to ſee our falts. Thirdly to examine ourſelues what we haue offended in. Laſtly to make a breife act of Contrition, that is of ſorrow for our ſinnes, and purpoſe to amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de them for the loue of God (as I shall shew within a leafe or two.) Beſides this we ought allwais to haue an eye ouer our owne behauiour, and when we haue offended God any way, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to thinke with ourſelues, this was a ſinne, I will remember it when I goe to Confeſſion. The examine before Confeſſion may be made by thought, word, and deed: and whether the ſinnes which he committed by thought, he did not alſo committe them by word, and if he committed them by word, whether he did not alſo in deede As for example BY THOVGHT: if he offended inwardly by anger in his hart, whether he did not alſo vtter ſome angry words, and whether he proceeded not to ſome actions to hurt his neighbour, or ſomething that belonged to him. And if he haue, let him Confeſſe it. I Confeſſe I was angry at my neighbour, and proceeded to ſuch and ſuch words and did ſuch and ſuch things againſt him, or intended to doe them. And ſoe in other ſinnes; as in carnal ſinnes, if he ſinned by thought, if he proceeded to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt words, and if to vnchaſt actions; for it is a greater ſinne to ſinne by word, then by thought onely, and by worke then by word onely. In the examining of his thoughts, he may thinke
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98706:186"/>whether he haue giuen way to any irreuerent thoughts againſt God, or his Saints, or to any dreams, or ſuperſtitious thoughts. If he hath thought euill of others, iudged rashly, borne hatred and ill will to any, bene ſorry at their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare or reioyced at their euill, deſired their death, or ſome hurt or loſſe to them. Thoughts of pride and vaine glory in our actions, deſire of praiſe, honors and preferments, too much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to worldly riches, vnchaſt thoughts. BY WORD. If he hath bene negligent in prayer, if he hath ſworne, and if it were vpon an vntruth, if he hath curſed his neighbour, or any other creature; and whether it were with a deſire of that euill towards them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or rashly onely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch deſire; if he hath made any vnlawfull vow; if he hath murmured at his ſuperiors, if he hath diſpraiſed and detracted from any; if he hath not reprehended thoſe vnder his charge; if he hath told vntruths wittingly, if he hath mocked or ſcoffed at any, councelled any to ſinne, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the good which they intended; if he hath ſpoken vnchaſt words, or ſung vnchaſt ſongs. BY DEEDES. If he hath vſed any ſuperſtitious actions, or omitted to doe any thinge for ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious cauſe, and conceit; if he hath wrought vpon holy dayes, or permitted others vnder his charge to worke, or if he hath omitted himſelfe, or hindered others to heare maſſe on holy dayes; if he hath not obeyed his parents, or ſuperiors, and if it were in any matter of moment, to tell what and how it was; if he hath broken his faſt; if he hath ſtrucken, beaten or willfully hurt any

Thus we may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ourſelues by thought, word, and deed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring eſpecially the occaſions which he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in, and the courſe of life and calling, which he profeſſeth, what ſinnes he committeth in it, and the circumſtances in which they were committed, whether there were not ſomethinge which might aggrauate the ſinne.</p>
               <p>It is an errour in ſome that if they get their wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed number of prayers ſaid they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wel prepared to confeſſion and come with litle or noe examining of conſcience at all. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe muſt vnderſtande that prayer is not the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per preparation for confeſſion, and that it is not a time then to ſay many prayers; but to ſtirre vp in themſelues a true repentance for their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by remembring them, ſorrowing for them, and purpoſing to amende them. This is then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but prayers are not neceſſarily required. And therefor we muſt be ſure to examine well,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:98706:187"/>our conſciences before confeſſion, that we come not of cuſtome, without deuotion, and due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to it. And when we haue done all that belongeth to the Sacram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt, then we may take time to pray.</p>
               <p>Hauing examined thy conſcience and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed againſt it the ſinnes which thou knoweſt, ſtirre vp in thy ſelfe a vehement ſorrow for them; and be indeede in thy hart confounded to thinke that thou haſt ſinned againe, and againe, without amending thoſe things which thou haſt ſoe often repented for. By which thou maſt thinke that there is but litle feruour of deuotion in thee; and that thou haſt great reaſon to feare that thou art of the number of the lukewarme, an therefor in great danger. Inflame in thy ſelfe an ardent loue of God, be ſorry that thou haſt ſoe litle feeling of ſorrow, and purpoſe firmly that now at laſt thou wilt beginne to amende, and wilt fly the occaſions by which thou art tempted, begging of God that he wil ſee this amendment in thee, and giue thee efficacious grace for the performing of it. Endeauour then to make a perfect act of contrition, which is very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all to vnderſtande and to learne.</p>
               <p>A perfect act of contrition is a perfect act of loue, that for the loue of God we are ſorry to haue offended him, and not for the shame of ſinne, feare of punishment, or loſſe of reward, which proceedeth from the loue of concupiſcence which is in vs, by which we regard our owne intereſt. And therefor ſuch shame or feare is not ſufficient for an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>act of true contrition, which includeth the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:98706:188"/>the loue of God aboue all things. This is an act of contrition, <hi>I loue thee ô God aboue all things in the world, and for thy owne ſake I am ſorry to haue offended thee.</hi> And this act if it be truely conceiued, and made in our harts is the moſt gratefull act to God that we can poſſibly make; for by it we offer vp our ſelues, all our actions, and all creatures to God as his owne, and as it were one ſacrifice due to him. And ſoe a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amending, and of confeſſing our ſinnes, and of keeping all the commandements of God is included in this act: and it is ſoe perfect, and pleaſing to him, that he that should haue it, and should dy before he could come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion should haue his mortal ſinnes forgiuen him, and be ſaued by vertue of it. For if Martyrs haue all their ſinnes forgiuen them by Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: becauſe they loue God more then their liues, and more then the whole world; ſoe shall he that hath a Martyrs charity, and is in the preparation of his minde a Martyr, in that he loueth God more then his owne life, and aboue all thinges in the world, and feareth more to offende him then he doth the paines of death or torments of hell. Therefor it is good for all to make ſuch acts of inward contrition, eſpecially before confeſſion; and to accuſtome themſelues often to make ſuch acts; that in all dangers when they haue not the opportunity of a prieſt for confeſſion, thy may fly vnto an act of contrition, as to a ſanctuary which in time of neede shall ſaue them.</p>
               <p>He that hath not ſoe perfect a loue of God, as
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98706:188"/>true contrition requireth muſt haue at leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition for his ſinnes which is a more imperfect loue mixed with feare of punishment, of loſſe of reward, or the like: which being ioyned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, is perfected by it, and becommeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition in effect, giuing grace and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. For it can not be thought but that the Sacrament being added to an act of attrition, more perfection muſt be added to it; and that is to giue grace. For as the Councell of Trent hath declared, the Sacrament of pennance is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the dead, becauſe it reuiueth to the ſtate of grace thoſe who were in the ſtate of ſinne, which they could not be with true contrition.</p>
               <p>The third thinge which the poenitent muſt haue before confeſſion is a firme purpoſe of amendement: which purpoſe although it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in an act of contrition; yet it is good to make it alwais expreſly by it ſelfe; becauſe we know not when we haue true contrition. And it is good allwais to make a purpoſe to amende, and to fly the occaſions of that ſinne in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which we offende moſt in. Neither is this purpoſe euer to be omitted, becauſe it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten broken; for if we should runne on ſtill in ſinne, and neuer purpoſe to amende, we should neuer amende: and if for all the good purpoſes which we make, we ſtill fall into ſinne, what would become of vs, if we made not thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and contrary acts to it The purpoſes which we make and the deteſtations of ſinne are a great meanes to hinder it; and a moſt ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne remedy it is againſt all ſinne, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:98706:189"/>againſt euill cuſtomes, preſently to make a contrary act in deteſtation of them, and to gett to confeſſion as ſoone as we can.</p>

               <p>HAVING prepared our ſelues with due examine of conſcience, ſorrow for our ſinnes, and purpoſe of amendment, the next part of this Sacrament is confeſſion. We come then to the prieſt, and with reuerence to the Sacrament we kneele downe at his feete full of ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. We may thinke then of the Magdalene how she came to the feete of Chriſt confeſſing her ſinnes; not in particular, for that she needed not to him who knew them allready, and ſaw the ſecrets of her hart; yet she confeſſed them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; if not by word of mouth, yet by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſorrow for them, and of much loue of God.

               <p>The poenitent kneeling downe ſaith <hi>Benedicite:</hi> that is to deſire the bleſſing of God, and of the prieſt for the worthy performing of that action. The prieſt then prayeth for him: then he ſaith <hi>I confeſſe mee to almighty God, to the bleſſed Virgin Mary, to S. Michael the Archangell, to S. Iohn Baptiſt, to S. Peter, and to S. Paul, and to all the Saints in heauen, that I haue offended by thought, word, and worke, through my fait,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:98706:189"/>through my falt, through my moſt greeuous falt.</hi> The meaning of which is to proſtrate himſelfe before God, and the whole court of heauen, and before the prieſt, as the Vicar of God vpon earth; to acknowledge, and confeſſe his falts. Then he beginneth to declare in particular what he hath offended in. For the rightly performing of which, he may vnderſtande three conditions to be principally neceſſary for a good confeſſion: to wit that it be intire, cleare, and obedient.</p>
               <p>For the firſt condition of integrity, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we confeſſe all the mortal ſinnes which we know ourſelues to be guilty of, expreſſing euery one of them in particular, the number and the circumſtances aggrauating them. Venial ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are not abſolutly neceſſary to be confeſſed; becauſe they are not quite oppoſite to the effect of the Sacrament; but may ſtande with grace; yet of deuotion we confeſſe them, for many reaſons aboue mentioned. Children and ſome very wicked perſons breake ſometimes this condition of integrity, and either becauſe they vnderſtande not, or conſider not the worke which they haue in hand, they conceale ſometimes their ſinnes from the prieſt: but this is indeede either very childish, or very impious, and sheweth that they haue not a true apprehenſion of the dignity of a Sacrament, nor of the ſtate of their ſoules, who onely receiue good or euill by that which they then doe; it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting nothing to any other whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe well or ill. Let theſe therefor vnderſtande, and conſider that this is the profanation of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, a heinous mortall ſinne; not as other
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:98706:190"/>mortall ſinnes of frailty, but of malice, againſt the firſt commandement, directly oppoſite to diuine worship. <hi>He that hideth his wicked deedes</hi> (ſaith the holy Prouerbe) <hi>shall not be directed:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.</note> 
                  <hi>but he that shall forſake them shall obtaine mercy.</hi> He bringeth vpon himſelfe not one but many euills. Firſt not confeſſing any mortall ſinne, he committeth a new mortal ſinne, and that of a higher nature. Secondly the ſinnes which he doth Confeſſe are not forgiuen. Thirdly all the ſinnes which he hath committed euer ſince he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to conceale, although he had Confeſſed them, he muſt Confeſſe them all ouer againe, with thoſe which he concealed: for although they were Confeſſed they were not forgiuen.</p>
               <p>The deuill noe doubt but laboureth all he can to hinder the fruit of this Sacrament, by which he looſeth ſoe many ſoules: and becauſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth ſometimes with ſuch as I haue mentioned, I will ſpeake a word or two for their good, that they may abhorre this ſinne. Firſt I tell them that this Sacrament is the onely remedy which God hath ordained for actual ſinne. Our ſoules were firſt loſt by original ſinne, and by Baptiſme they were ſaued from that shipwrack; but falling after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme into actual ſinne, there is noe hopes to be ſaued, but by duely receiuing the Sacrament of pennance:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiero. ep.</hi> 8. <hi>ad Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rriad Amb. ad virg. lapſ c.</hi> 8.</note> and therfor Saints and ſpiritual men commonly call it the ſecond planke of ſaluation in the shipwracke of our ſoules. Tell mee then O faintharted Catholike, that art affraide to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thy ſinnes: if that thou wert floating on the waues of the ſea vpon a good and ſure planke,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:98706:190"/>wouldſt thou be ouercome with feare to forſake it? why then art thou ouercome with feare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale thy ſinnes in that pittifull ſtate of damnation: ſeeing that by concealing them thou doſt let goe the planke in which is all thy hope, and without which thou ſinkeſt downe, and art ſure to perish. Thou haſt ſuffered shipwracke by mortal ſinne, wilt thou let goe thy ſauing planke, and perish in the waues? Thou art wounded mortally and art ſicke vnto death; if thou diſcouer not thy wounds, thou dyeſt with out remedy: wilt thou languish vnto death and willfully refuſe all helpe? Thou haſt a phyſitian that can cure thee, and that as priuatly as thou canſt deſire, and with as litle shame to thee; but thou muſt either tell thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and shew thy wounds or dy. Thus doe the holy fathers declare the neceſſity of intire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. Further if thou diſſembleſt with the prieſt thou diſſembleſt with God, and adding ſinne vnto ſinne thou woundeſt thy ſoule with a new and deeper wound, and with a ſinne which is moſt oppoſite to grace, and to the forgiueneſſe of any ſinne: and that very ſinne which now thou wilt not Confeſſe priuatly, thou shalt be forced to Confeſſe it one day, in the ſight and hearing of all the world, when the deuill shall accuſe thee publikely, ſaying I gotte him to committe ſuch a ſinne, and to conceale it in Confeſſion: I accuſe him of the ſinne, and of a ſacrilegious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And Chriſt will then be ashamed of thee before his Angels, that wert ashamed of him before thy ghoſtly father; and thou shalt be condemned as guilty of both ſinnes; and shalt goe amongſt
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:98706:191"/>the damned. This is all that thou shalt gett by thy shame; for in this world thou didſt gett nothing at all. Other ſinnes when they are committed bring either ſome profit or pleaſure with them; but this hath neither profit nor pleaſure in it, but euen then when thou committeſt it, thou haſt an inward horu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour and paine, to thinke of the loſſe which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tho ſuſteineſt and of the comfort of a good Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and how greeuouſly thou woundeſt thy ſoule, with a new and more greeuous wounde. If thou didſt ſee thy vtter enemy laid pittifully wounded in danger of death, and the ſurgeon dreſſing him and binding vp his wounds; couldeſt thou finde in thy hart to come to him, and tearing of his plaſter, to wounde him againe with a new and worſe wounde? Such an enemy thou art vnto thy ſelfe, when being at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion vnder the hands of the prieſt, thou hideſt any mortal ſinne. Thou abuſeſt the onely remedy of thy ſoule, and being wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and then in cure, thou teareſt of the plaſter, and woundeſt thy ſelfe againe with a new and more greeuous mortal ſinne, and ſuch an one as in it ſelfe is contrary to all remedy.</p>
               <p>It was very remarkable to this purpoſe that which happened not long ſince in a citty of Spaine. A notorious malefactour being ſentenced to dy, was put into the place of retirement which they haue in the priſon for condemned perſons to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues in for their death. And comming to Confeſſion he beganne to be troubled and could not goe on; but made ſtrange geſtures and shewes of affrightment when he would haue Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſome ſinnes. The Prieſt, who was my very charitable good freind, and who told mee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:98706:191"/>all that I am now relating perceiuing it, and asking the cauſe of it; with much difficulty at laſt he anſwered, and told him planely that the deuill was there, and threatened him that he durſt not Confeſſe. At which the prieſt roze vp and with the ſigne the Cros vanquished him. But the deuill (who vſeth not to yeeld at the firſt repulſe) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe, and at the Confeſſing of ſome ſinnes troubled him as before; and the prieſt againe vanquished him. And thus returning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral times he putte the poore man into ſuch an amaze and feare, that he durſt not Confeſſe but made an end concealing ſome of his ſinnes. The prieſt gaue ſentence of abſolution, but it was in vaine and of noe value, as a iudge miſinformed; the party remaining guilty of all his former ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and of one more, and that perhaps greater then any which he had to Confeſſe. That night the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill appeared vnto him all in flames, threatening him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot to Confeſſe ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, which he had concealed: and with all he commanded him to throw away that which he had about his necke (which was a litle Cros and image of our bleſſed lady, which the prieſt ſent to a brother of his owne, liuing then aboue a thouſand miles from him; who wore them and after ſome yeares shewed them to mee.) In what a terrour may we imagine that man then to haue bene and fearfull perplexity, to obey or to diſobey the deuils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande? he thought them then to be his onely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and ſaw that if he threw them away he diſarmed himſelfe: and on the otherſide he feared his threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he obeyed not. But he choſe for better
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:98706:192"/>to diſobey him, and it was a happy diſobedience: for his prowde enemy confounded with it, vanis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed away preſently with out hurting him. The man expected vntill morning, longing to ſee the prieſts returne; whom as ſoone as he ſaw, he ranne preſently to him, and glaſping him in his armes, he beſought him to heare his Confeſſion againe, and then he made a better Confeſſion, declaring intirely the ſinnes which he had concealed, and the ſacrilege which he had committed in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. And relating all that had paſſed with him, he deſired at his death the prieſt to tell it vnto others, that they might learne by him to make good Confeſſions. Who related it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in his ſermon to all that were preſent at the malefactors execution. This happened in a place of Spaine which I know very well; and there can be noe queſtion of the truth of it. Thoſe who in Confeſſion conceale any mortal ſinne, are as this man was in the deuils power, and to gett out of it muſt doe that which he did; and that was to cleere himſelfe by a better Confeſſion: but this is a greater mercy then they deſerue.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that beginne once to diſſemble in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion put themſelues in the worſt ſtate and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger that a ſinner can be in this world: for they make themſelues vncapable of remedy; and can neuer be rightly delt with by the prieſt: who not knowing the ſtate of their conſcience, looſeth his labour by all which he ſaith to them. Nay ſometimes it may chance that he may conſaile them to that which is a ſinne. For example one of theſe men being ſlacke in comming to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:98706:192"/>if the prieſt call vpon him, he calleth him to a mortal ſinne: and againe if he come not to annual Confeſſion, he committeth a mortal ſinne. What conſaile can be giuen them in this caſe? if we counſaile them either to a badde Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or to noe Confeſſion, we counſaile them to their damnation: and one of theſe we muſt doe, if they will not Confeſſe intirely. Yet I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to counſaile them rather to abſteine from Confeſſion, and ſoe from Communion alſo at Eaſter time; then to diſſemble in Confeſſion. This I doe not abſolutly counſaile; for this is alſo to damne themſelues; but ſeeing that they are otherwiſe reſolued vpon a greater dishonour to God, and greater damnation, I perſwade them to the leſſe. That which I abſolutly perſwade them is to be conuerted in their harts, and by a good Confeſſion to giue glory to God, ioy to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſatisfaction to their owne conſciences. O chriſtian if thou didſt but conſider the value of a Sacrament, and how deerely the Sonne of God bought it for thee, thou wouldſt be affraide to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de it vnder thy feete, as thou doeſt when thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſt it. If therefor thou art reſolued to be a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and a Catholike, abuſe not Chriſt in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholike Church. Be not ſoe wicked or ſoe childish, as for a litle shame to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte that ſinne which thou haſt neither profit nor pleaſure in, but looſeſt that which in the end muſt be thy onely remedy. Ouercome thy ſelfe in this, as thou doſt in the other auſteritys of the Catholike profeſſion: ſpeake freely thy ſinnes, or els thou hadſt better be noe Catholike nor chriſtian.</p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:98706:193"/>
               <p>The next condition is that it be plane and cleere. This muſt proceede from an earneſt deſire of being rightly vnderſtoode by the prieſt. And for this a conuenient breuity is beſt: not to be tedious in rehearſing that, which is not neceſſary; and yet ſoe, as the nature of the ſinne and the circumſtances aggrauating it be rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode. Regard not then any fine words or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtile, but ſpeake ſimply, and familiarly, as to an intimate freind of thine, whom God hath ſent to ſitte in his tribunal. wha will the eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of orators or the tongue of a lawyer auaile thee at the day of iudgment? It shall not then be asked how eloquently thou haſt Confeſſed, but how humbly and truely. If we feare that the prieſt heare vs not or vnderſtande not right, we may aske him. Father doe you heare mee? or doe you vnderſtande mee? And when we haue confeſſed all we make an end ſaying, <hi>therefor I beſeech the bleſſed Virgin Mary, S. Michael the Archangell, S. Iohn Baptiſt S Peter and S. Paul, and all the Saints in heauen, and you my ghoſtly father to pray for mee.</hi> Hauing ſaid this he attendeth quietly to the prieſt to be directed by him. If he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten any thinge in Confeſſion, or not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the prieſt, he may ſay Father I had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch a thinge, I vnderſtande you not &amp;c. And hauing rightly vnderſtode his pennance, and the aduiſes which are giuen him, he muſt fixe his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de earneſtly vpon God at the time of abſolution, and take heed then of diſtractions; for ſoe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> might come to looſe the benefit of the Sacrament for that time: and therfor it is good then to be
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:98706:193"/>making acts of the loue of God and of ſorrow, and to vſe ſome good words; as thoſe of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Publican who knocking his breaſt and ſaying <hi>God be mercifull to mee a ſinner,</hi>

               <p>The third condition of a good Confeſſion is to be obedient; that is that the poenitent accept of thoſe remedys which are praeſcribed him: that he auoide the occaſions of ſinne, make reſtitution if it be needfull, and performe carefully the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which is enioyned him. Of which we shall ſpeake in ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary for all to know that Confeſſion in ſome caſes is voide, and moſt be reiterated; and which theſe caſes are. The firſt is want of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient examination of conſcience, when the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent vſeth not due diligence in remembring of his ſinnes, that he omitteth through negligence any mortal ſinne, he muſt then make all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ouer againe. Secondly if willfully he ſpeake any vntruth in Confeſſion in ſome matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thirdly if he conceale willfully any mortal ſinne. Fourthly if he hath not a firme purpoſe to leaue of ſome mortal ſinne, or to fly the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. Fiftly, if the poenitent were fallen into ſome excommunication, and did not firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to be abſolued from it. Sixtly, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour were deficient in knowledge power, or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. In all which caſes the poenitent is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de not onely to Confeſſe his ſinnes ouer againe; but alſo to Confeſſe the ſinne which he committed in ſoe Confeſſing.</p>

               <p>THE third and laſt part of the Sacrament of Pennance is Satisfaction. That is that we accept and performe ſome penalty for our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in lieu of that punishment, which we should haue ſuffered in the next world, if we had not here preuented it. For the which we are to vnderſtande that euery ſinne includeth two things: to wit the auerſion of the ſinner from God, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion to ſome creature for which he forſaketh God. And on the contrary when our ſinnes are forgiuen, and we are reſtored to the ſtate of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, there are two things; to wit an auerſion from the creature and conuerſion to God. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion to God and reſtoring of the ſinner to his fauour againe, taketh away the ſtaine and blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish of ſinne, and freeth from hell; but being that his auerſion from the creature and conuerſion to God againe is not allwais ſoe intenſe and ferue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as his conuerſion to the creature and auerſion from God was; therefor there remaineth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome punishment to be ſuffered by reaſon of his cold conuerſion. Now there are in euery ſinne two euils of punishment correſponding to the two euils aforeſaid in the ſinne. The one is the loſſe of God and ſeparation from him, which correſpondeth to the auerſion of the ſinner from God: the other is a ſenſible punishment correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding to our conuerſion to the creature, for the ſenſible pleaſure which we tooke in it. The firſt euill of the loſſe of God is repaired by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:98706:194"/>to him in confeſſion: by which we are reſtored to his fauour againe. But the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſenſes is not allwais quite taken away; but as our auerſion from God and conuerſion to the creature for ſenſible pleaſure was more earneſt and intenſe then our conuerſion is to God againe; ſoe it is fitting that ſome ſenſible paine should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to be ſuſteined. Theſe are the grounds of the Catholike doctrine of Satisfaction and of Purgatory: of both which we wil ſay ſomethinge here, as in their propper place.</p>
               <p>If I ſaid noe more in proofe of this doctrine but onely that the Bishop of Rome and Paſtors of his communion deliuered it, I had in reaſon ſaid enough: For he being the head of the Church, as the true and lawfull ſucceſſour in S. Peters primacy (as I haue shewed him to be) he and the Paſtors of his communion haue the lawfull authority of the whole, Church, and are the whole Catholike Church in authority: and being that we muſt alwais ſay <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church;</hi> we muſt allwais beleeue and obey the ſucceſſion of that authority. But I will ſay ſomethinge in particular of them. That which the Catholike Church teacheth of Satisfaction is that although the conuerſion of a ſinner to God may be ſoe intenſe and perfect ſometimes, that he may obtaine a full remiſſion of all punishment, and be as it were new borne to God in baptiſme; yet this doth not allwais happen. Our conuerſion to God is not allwais ſoe intenſe and perfect, but that there may and commonly doth remaine ſome punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:98706:195"/>to be ſuffered after it. This we shew firſt by holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>When the children of Iſrael ſinned by murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God and their Paſtors, Moyſet praying obtained the remiſſion of their ſinne. <hi>But yet</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>all the men that haue ſeene my Maicſty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nu.</hi> 20.</note> Moyſes and Aaron ſinned at the waters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: and when their ſinne was forgiuen there remained a penalty to be endured by them, and they endured it, not bringing the people into the holy land Dauid had ſinned by murder, and adultery; and Nathan being ſent to reprooue him, and bring him to repentance,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.12.</note> he repented, and deſerued to heare from the Prophet <hi>our Lord hath taken away thy ſinne thou shalt not dy.</hi> But his ſinne being taken away, it was not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing punished with the death of his ſonne, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet declaring <hi>the ſonne which is borne to thee dying shall dy.</hi> And for all king Dauids earneſt praying, faſting and lying on the ground, he could not obtaine the life of the child. By all which we ſee that punishment of ſinne may remaine to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, when the ſinne is forgiuen.</p>
               <p>It Was therfor the cuſtome of the Catholike Church aunciently, as now it is, to impoſe penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys vpon ſinners at their repentance, as by auncient Canons doth appeare.

               </p>
               <p>It is againſt reaſon that he, that commeth to confeſſion with many mortal ſinnes, should thinke to haue noe more puishment then he that hath but one onely, if they be diſpoſed with equal deuotion. Yet they were both alike, if they had noe more punihment but onely to confeſſe, and that then all ſinne and punishment were taken away. Sinne therfor and punishment are onely ſoe farre correlatiues, that punishment allwais ſuppoſeth ſinne to haue bene; but doth not require that there be then actually ſinne. Neither is it worth any thinge that which, haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks obiect againſt this. That Chriſt ſatysfyed for vs; therefor we neede not to ſatisfy for our ſelues: noe more then it is to ſay, Chriſt did good works for vs: therefor wee neede nor to doe good works for our ſelues. Our good works derogate not from the good works of Chriſt, nor our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from his Satisfactions. our good works haue their value from his, and ſoe hath our ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: but neither of them is hindered by him. Thus much for Satisfaction, and for the enioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pennance after the remiffion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>As for Purgatory it followeth hence, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who dy with their ſinnes forgiuen them; but haue not that intenſe ſorrow and perfect repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce which is neceſſary for the remiſſion of all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment due to their ſinnes, muſt haue their punishment in ſome place in the next world,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:98706:196"/>where they muſt be purged from that guilt of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment (as alſo of their leſſer ſinnes before that they can enter into heauen.) Aërius was one of the firſt that denyed Purgatory: and that which he gott for it was to be recorded as an hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike euer from the times of the primitiue Church, and to haue his doctrine in theliſt of thoſe whom S. Epiphanius, haer. 75. And S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine haer. 83. haue branded with the marke of haereſy. Luther at firſt although he denyed indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, yet was ſoe reſolute in the mainteining of Purgatory, that in his diſputation with Eckius he would needs make publike profeſſion of it, ſaying <hi>I firmely beleeue and dare boldly ſay I know there is a Purgatory whatſoeuer haeretiks raile againſt it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſp. lipſ.</note> But hauing once fallen from the Catholike Church he was conſtant to nothing but vnconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and came in the end to deny Purgatory alſo. But the Catholike Church hath allwais acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that there is a place for the ſoules of thoſe to be purged in, who dy in venial ſinne, or haue not made full ſatisfaction for their mortal, which place therfor may aptly be called <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is ſuch a place, it appeareth in all thoſe ſentences of Scriptures, where prayer for the dead is commended.

               <p>The doctrine of Purgatory is ſoe planely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the auncient fathers of the Church that, Caluin could not deny or conceale it: but l. 3.

But who can endure this ſaying in him? were the auncient fathers of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:98706:197"/>the Church, and both the Church which was aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and which was when Caluin came into the world deceided, and Caluin not deceiued? shall Caluin take vpon him to correct the auncient fathers and preſent obſeruations of the Church? And shall any hazard his ſoule with Caluin againſt them? He asketh what authority of Scriptures they had? Muſt the whole Church be examined by him in the Scriptures? And shall not he be thought an haeretike for this, and to abuſe the Scriptures in condemning of the Church? <hi>S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine shall anſwere him.
<note place="margin">Aug. l. de cura pro mortuis.</note> 
                  <hi>Jn the books of the Machabees we read that ſacrifice was offered for the dead: but although in the auncient Scriptures it were not at all to be read, the authority of the vniuerſal Church is noe small matter which is cleere for this cuſtome, where in the prayers of the prieſt which to our Lord God are powered forth at his altare, the commendation of the dead hath its place.</hi> S. Auguſtins argument was good, in which he prooued Purgatory both hy the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Church. But if this be not enough for Caluin, to whom nothing will ſerue but his owne will and word. We will alſo produce his owne words againſt him: l. 4. Inſtit. c. 2. num. 3. he ſaith that <hi>without controuerſy nothing from the beginning untill that age was changed in doctrine.</hi> To wit vntill the times of Tertullian, Origen and Auguſtine, of whom he was ſpeaking. If therfor this were the doctrine of the Church in thoſe times, it was the doctrine of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles euer from the beginning. And ſoe Caluin is condemned by Scriptures, fathers,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:98706:197"/>Church, and by his owne words; and Purgatory is prooued to be the true Catholike, Apoſtolike doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. There for pennances are rightly enioyned, prayers may be ſaid, almes deeds giuen, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences granted, and many voluntary afflictions haue bene vndergone by the Saints, and faithfull of the Catholike Church, to eſcape the paines of Purgatory: which although they be but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: yet they are moſt greeuous, and vehement, more then can be ſpoken. And becauſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine of Indulgences by many is not vnderſtoode, I wil ſay ſomethinge of them in this, which is alſo their propper place.</p>
               <p>An Indulgence is as much as to ſay a fauour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able remiſſion or pardoning of ſome due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Such are the indulgences of the Church either abſolute remiſſions, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or impoſing of any other taske; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes of a greater into a leſſer penalty. The power of granting indulgences, or abſoluing from punishment (which is all one) was granted by Chriſt vnto his Apoſtles, and eſpecially to S. Peter, to whom he promiſed the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</note> and told him <hi>whatſoeuer thou shalt looſe vpon earth shall be looſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> What can be vnderſtoode by the keyes of heauen, and the words following but power ſoe to open heauen gates, as to take away all that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth for entring in at them: to wit ſinne and punishment? He gave alſo the like authority to the reſt of the Apoſtles ſaying <hi>whatſoeuer you shall looſe vpon earth shal be looſed in heauen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</note> If whatſoeuer they looſe be looſed, then punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:98706:198"/>looſed by them on earth, is looſed alſo in the ſight of God in heauen. Neither is there any good connexion in thoſe words, if they be not vnderſtoode of abſoluing, as well from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as from ſinne.</p>
               <p>Now if any aske how it can be, that ſinnes of which the diuine iuſtice requireth ſoe much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, should be ſatisfyed for with ſoe litle, as ſome indulgences require; and ſome indulgences require nothing at all to be done for the gaining of them:) he may vnderſtande that indulgence or pardon of punishment is neuer granted; but full ſatisfaction is made to God for the ſinne. For there is in the Church a treaſury of Satisfactions ſoe great, that it can neuer be exhauſted by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying for ſinnes. There are in this treaſury the ſatisfactions of Chriſt infinitly more, then all the ſinnes in the world can require. There are alſo the good works of our B. Lady; that had nothing of her owne to ſatisfy for. There are the good works of S. Iohn Baptiſt, of the Apoſtles, and of many others whoſe works were much more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory then their owne ſinnes needed, and may be applyed by the paſtors of the Church to thoſe that ſtande neede of them. For the Church is a body, and all the members of it haue a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and participation of good works with one another, as we profeſſe in the Creede ſaying, I beleeue <hi>the Communion of Saints.</hi> And the pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſayeth.

               <p>If any aske why the Pope onely and bishops giue indulgences? I anſwere that the words of Chriſt before alleadged were ſpoken onely to S. Peter, who was to be the Pope, and to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles who were at firſt the onely bishops of the Church. And the practiſe of the vniuerſal Church, which ought to be our rule in all things, hath bene allwais for the Pope and bishops, and not for prieſts to grant Indulgences. S. Auguſtine ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the obſeruations of the Church ſaith, <hi>If the Church through out the World frequent any of theſe things to diſpute of it as not to be done is moſt inſolent madnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 118.</note> To queſtion that which the whole Church obſerueth, or curiouſly to diſpute of it is full of danger and preſumption: but ſoe as to diſallow of it and to condemne it, is abſolute mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the propper madnes of hereſy.</p>
               <p>Now as you haue ſeene the power of granting indulgences to be deriued from Chriſt; ſoe you shall ſee the practiſe of it to haue bene in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church. Although then they were neither ſoe commune, nor ſolemne as now a dayes. Firſt becauſe in thoſe times of perſecution chriſtians could not ſoe frequently meete together. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the graces and gifts of the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors were then greater, and aequiualent
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:98706:199"/>to the benefit of indulgences. Thirdly the feruour and deuotion of thoſe chriſtians was alſo greater, the blood of Chriſt being yet warme (and as S. Hierome ſaith boyling in them.) That they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtoode ſoe much neede of indulgences, nor were their punishments often remitted. Yet S. Paul exercized this power, when in the perſon of Chriſt he gaue indulgence or pardon (as he term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it) to the ſinfull Corinthian, leaſt he should haue bene ſwallowed vp with ſorrow at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his punishment.

For my ſelfe alſo that which I pardoned, if I pardoned any thinge for you in the perſon of Chriſt.</hi> Thus S. Paul pardoned him: and not onely in the ſight of the Church, but alſo in the ſight of God: for otherwiſe this pardon had been to his hurt, and he had not pardoned in the perſon of Chriſt, who hurteth not by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons. Tertullian. lib. ad martyres. c. 1. and S. Cyprian l. 3. c. 15. &amp; ſer. de lapſ. affirme that it was then the cuſtome of bishops, at the intreaty of thoſe who were deſigned to martyrdome, to grant pardons to offenders from the penaltys of the Church. That which S. Paul and theſe bishops did was the very ſame which the Catholike Church now doth in giuing of indulgences: for they are nothing els but the releaſing of punishments in the ſight of God. Diuerſe examples and canons of the Church for this are to be ſeene in authors, which for breuity I omitte.</p>
               <p>Indulgences vpon a iuſt cauſe, and for a good end may ſometimes be granted without the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning of any penalty. As thoſe were which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiuely
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:98706:199"/>were granted at the interceſſion of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; and thoſe which are now granted to ſome at their deaths, for ſome great deſerts and good ſeruice allready done to the Church. But ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſome pious worke is praeſcribed; and ſoe a greater punishment is changed into a leſſe. That which is required to be done ought to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much deuotion; and to gaine the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence it muſt be done in ſtate of grace; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for Confeſſion and Contrition are for the moſt part expreſly required in euery indulgence.</p>
               <p>Indulgences which are granted to the ſoules in purgatory are applyed vnto them onely by way of ſuffrage, that is by a pious offering of ours to pay their debt, and not by applying any power or iuriſdiction of the Church ouer them. For the paſtors of the Church haue power and iuriſdiction ouer the militant Church onely, ouer which they can viſibly exercize their power of gouernment.</p>
               <p>By indulgences we are not to vnderſtande that ſoe many yeares, or dayes of purgatory are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but that ſoe much punishment is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, as ſoe many yeares or dayes pennance should haue ſatisfyed for, according to the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the primitiue Church. A plenary indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is a full and totall pardon of all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſight of God. A Quarentine is as much as to ſay an indulgence correſponding to the pennance of forty dayes: which aunciently was a time of prayer, faſting, and other auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys in thoſe times often vſed, and was called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragena a Quarentin;</hi> and when it was with bread and water onely, it was called <hi>Carentia, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:98706:200"/>from meates.</hi> A Iubily is a more ſolemne kind of indulgence. It is is an hedrew word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>ioy</hi> or <hi>reioycing.</hi> The Iſraëlits euery fiftith yeare had a Iubily yeare: which was ſoe ſolemne that they abſteined from tillage in it. Lands that were ſold returned to their owner, ſlaues were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchized, banished men reſtored, debtors ſet at liberty. All but in figure of the ſpirituall ioy and liberty which we obtaine in Chriſt. And therefor we haue now a yeare of iubily: which at firſt was kept euery hundreth yeare, then euery fiftith, now euery twenty fift. The faithfull being piouſly inuited to Rome, a place allwais frequented for indulgences, and where Saints haue ſoe much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to liue, that S. Catherine of Siena vſed to ſay <hi>I treade vpon the blood of martyrs at Rome.</hi> There doth the holy Vicar of Chriſt himſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine his people, wash their feete, make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to them, and ſpareth nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the loue and ſeruice of God in them.</p>
               <p>Thus much as to the declaration of ſatisfaction; which is the third part of the Sacrament of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Hauing Confeſſed our ſinnes, and receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our pennance, and abſolution from the prieſt, we muſt remember well the aduiſes which were giuen vs, and purpoſe to keepe them: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our pennance preſently, leaſt we should forgette it or any part of it. It is a ſigne of loue and reuerence to God, when we goe willingly and readily to pay that which we owe him.</p>
               <p>I haue now but one word more to ſay of this Sacrament, and that is to exhort all to frequent it, and to coniure him vehemently that is fallen
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:98706:200"/>into any greater ſinne, preſently to ſeeke out a prieſt and to gette his conſcience cleered by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and if he hath not then the opportunity of a prieſt, to fly inſtantly to an act of Contrition, and to make it with all the feruour and humility, that poſſibly he can, and in the meane time to ſlippe noe occaſion of Confeſſion. Truely I thinke I may ſay, that amongſt ſoe many good remedys, as ſpiritual men haue praeſcribed for particular ſinnes, it is the beſt and moſt general againſt all ſinnes whatſoeuer to repent preſently by a good Confeſſion of them. For as great wounds are eaſily cured when they are brought preſently into the ſurgeons hands, and by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and not applying remedy in time, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vncurable and without remedy: ſoe the longer we differre our Confeſſion, the harder we make our Conuerſion, and if we ſtay long in ſinne we harden our harts ſtill more and more, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we come in the end to the vtter contempt of God, and of our owne ſoules. And therefor I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all from this very inſtant to purpoſe with themſelues that if they chance at any time through frailty to fall into ſome great ſinne, they will ſeeke preſently to Confeſſion after it. O thou that feareſt not to be in mortal ſinne, if thou didſt but vnderſtande the heinous condition in which thou art, that thou ſtandeſt then face to face at defyance with God, who with one word of his will can ſtrike thee downe inſtantly into hell; and what it is to want the mediation of Chriſt, of our B. Lady, thy good Angell, thy patrone, and of all the Saints, and the ſuffrages
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:98706:201"/>of the Church, thou wouldſt not remaine one moment in that ſtate. <hi>It is a humane thinge</hi> (ſaith S. Gregory) <hi>to erre; but diabolical to perſeuer in it.</hi> If we fall into ſinne we doe but like men, if we rize againe, we doe as the Saints haue done; but if we perſeuer in ſinne, we are like the deuil, who muſt remaine in ſinne for euer.</p>

Ambroſe alſo expreſſeth it; and to offer ſacrifice is the moſt propper office of prieſts; prieſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice going allwais together, ſoe that there can be noe prieſt, but he muſt haue power to offer ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>The propper and peculiar effect of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:98706:203"/>is to giue grace to exercize worthily Eccleſiaſtical functions. Which power and grace as it is in the Church of Chriſt is moſt high and eminent aboue all dignitys. For what can be compared to the dignity of chriſtian prieſts? Both in reſpect of their power of Orders, by which they conſecrate the moſt bleſed hoſt, and alſo in reſpect of their power of iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which they remitte ſinnes? Neither of which is within the Angels power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for prieſthood is not obtained in the Catholike Church, but after diuerſe yeares preparation; the lower Orders being firſt receiued, and after them Subdeaconship, after that Deaconship, after Deaconship prieſthood: euery one of the higher Orders in ſeueral yeares; that the dignity of prieſthood may be aſcended vnto by degrees, and with ſufficient time of probation.</p>
               <p>The lower orders are fower: Porter, Lector, Exerciſt, Acolyt. They are called lower or leſſer orders; becauſe they haue a more remote relation to the bleſſed Sacrament then the higher orders haue, in which relation the dignity of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doth cheifly conſiſt, of prieſts in conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, of Deacons and Subdeacons in aſſiſting about the altare at the conſecration of it; and of the lower orders concurring in their nature, though more temotely, to the decent miniſtring of it. The office of the Porter is to open and shutt the doores of the Church, to admitte of the faithfull, and to exclude the faithleſſe out of it, and to ring the bells. The office of the Lector is to reade the leſſons of the old and new teſtament,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:98706:203"/>which aunciently the bishop vſed to expound. The office of the Exorciſt is to expell the deuill, and to hinder his power ouer thoſe who are to be, or are allready baptiſed, and to prepare water in the font. (of which reade the ſecond article of the Creede towards the end) This power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Chriſt,

The office of the Deacon is to attende vpon the bishop at all times, but eſpecially to guard him, and the prieſt at maſſe, and at Sermon; and to be as it were the eye of the Bishop to obſerue the liues of the people, to ſee that they come to diuine ſeruice, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him of their behauiour within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> Theſe are the orders of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. <hi>Thoſe things that are of God, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, that is they are with order.

               <p>As there are ſeueral degrees of orders, ſoe there are ſeueral degrees of prieſts. Firſt there are ordinary prieſts, and then Bishops, and betwixt prieſts and bishops there is noe degree of orders. Thoſe who were aunciently called <hi>Choriepiſcopi</hi> that is to ſay Vicars of Bishops being ſometimes onely prieſts, although they had priueleges aboue ordinary prieſts, as to giue lower orders, as alſo Rural Deanes might haue: ſometimes being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour bishops and had licence to ordaine with higher orders; but they were not of any order betwixt prieſts and bishops; but either onely prieſts, or true bishops. Aboue Bishops are Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, then Patriarks, then Cardinals, and aboue all the Pope. Which is an honorable title decreed aboue a thouſand yeares ſince to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to none but to the bishop of Rome, as to the moſt eminent father of all; whom therfor S.

               </p>
               <p>As the inward acts of our minde which we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to God are ſpirituals hoſts or ſacrifices; ſoe all men may be ſaid to be ſpiritually prieſts by their holy and feruerous affections which God ſetteth on fire in their harts.

                  <hi>but he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God as Aaron.</hi> It is a dignity which muſt not be taken, if not giuen. All were not prieſts in the law of Moyſes, but onely the ſonnes of Aaron to offer ſacrifice to God. And we reade in the Scriptures of the great punishments of God vpon prowde and praeſumptuous men who haue aſſumed that dignity without order to themſelues. Soe great is the dignity of prieſthood, that S. Francis vſed to ſay, that if he should meete with a ſaint from heauen, and with a prieſt together, he would not doe reuerence to the ſaint, vntill he had kiſſed the prieſts hands.

               </p>
               <p>For the greater honour of prieſtshood, and that prieſts may attende better to the performing of that high function, the Catholike Church hath all wais annexed chaſtity to it, neuer permitting her prieſts to marry. And therefor thoſe that will be prieſts muſt be willing to vndergoe the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fingle and continent life. He that rightly conſidereth the dignity of prieſthood and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence which virginity hath before marriage wil eaſily condeſcende to this inſtitution of the Church. S. Paul generally councelleth virginity,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7.</note> and foretelleth to thoſe that marry the tribulations
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98706:205"/>which they shal haue; requiring of thoſe that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue wiues, that they be as thoſe that haue not wiues (which is very hard for them to be) and ſaith that he that is without wife is careful of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe thinges which pertaine to our Lord, how to pleaſe God: but the married man is diuided betwixt the loue of his wife and how he shall both ſerue God, and attende to his family. By all which it is manifeſt that the true and ſyncere meaning of the Apoſtle was to commende vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity. and to preferre chaſtity before a married life. And as manifeſt it is according to his words that the inconueniences, and diſtractions of marriage are leaſt ſuetable to the office of prieſts, who of all men ought to be moſt vnited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant with God, and to follow the example of Chriſt their maſter, who was a prieſt, and a virgin, borne of a virgin.</p>

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:98706:206"/>and wife by it are taught how to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to each other. Chriſt loueth his Church with an infinite loue; the Church alſo loueth him with a continuall and neuer interrupted loue. Chriſt ſuffered for his Church, giuing euen his life to gaine her an immaculate Spouſe.

                  <hi>a bloody spouſe, thou art to mee,</hi> when she ſaw the blood of her children circumciſed by him.

Finally Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of his father allwais ready to mediate for his Church in heauen, and hath prouided to remaine alſo with her in the B. Sacrament allwais vpon earth: and the Church reciprocally laboreth for him, giuing Sacraments, offering ſacrifice, exhorting, commanding, reprehending, and punishing of her people to make them honour him. Thus ought man and wife to liue together in continuall loue, and to beare patiently, and contentedly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the tribulations of marriage; not vpbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another with their falts, but with wiſe and milde termes, to procure the amendment

               <p>Of this, vnion, loue and goodnes of married folkes dependeth very much the good of all mankind; and therfor it is often and earneſtly commended in the Scriptures.

And therefor Adam called her his fellow companion, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating with him in a happy and good company, all diſſenſion and diuiſion betwixt them being contrary to the Sacrament, and in it ſelfe moſt greeuous eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the diuiding of liuing flesh, which bleedeth and ſmarteth on both ſides; or as the cutting of the whole body into two, which can not be, but with exceſſiue torment and certaine death. Soe the diuiſion and diſſention betwixt
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:98706:207"/>man and wife is allwais painefull on both ſides, and if it be in a matter of moment or with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, it is death and damnation to their ſoules.</p>
               <p>The beſt therefor is to reflect well vpon the inconueniences of marriage before hand, and to preuent them. Yong folke many times deceiue themſelues, who ſetting their mindes too earneſtly vpon marriage, imagin great happines and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but content in it. But this content laſteth but a while with them. For as ſoone as they feele the tribulations of that ſtate, they beginne to loath it, and by litle, and litle to thinke them vntol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and to wish themſelues vnmarried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And this is ſoe commune that, as the ſaying is, one prieſt hat could vnmarry would haue worke enough for many prieſts. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble litle children that cry after their mothers, they will not be quiet till they haue their deſire, and within a while they beginne to be weary, and cry to be backe againe. Marriages that are made without due conſideration, and eſpecially with out being well commended to God, haue many times the like iſſue: and theſe are often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to be of thoſe who marry very yong, who indeede ſeldome apprehende rightly, that which they vndertake. But what remedy? When they are once married there is then none but in true vertue and a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience: they muſt ſetle themſelues, and be contented with the ſower and the ſweet, taking one with the other as it shall pleaſe God to ſende them; and when any Cros happeneth, with a conſtant and heroical minde to beare it for Gods ſake, and to accuſtome themſelues to ſome
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:98706:207"/>good words in thoſe occaſions: as, <hi>Gods will be done,</hi> or the like, expecting patiently and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully a change when he shall ſend it; and God will ſend a good change, if they expect his time.</p>
               <p>But the remedy of remedys and the prime remedy for all inconueniences should haue bene to haue foreſeene and preuented them before marriage, by conſidering well, whether they were called of God, or noe, to that ſtate of life. And this I will tell them how they shall examine it. Firſt let them reſolue that in this buſines which concerneth them for all their life after, they will doe nothing rashly; but will take time to conſider of it, and to commende it well to God, and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had the Councell of their ghoſtly father and his prayers, and confeſſed and communicated for that end, let them then take a time to conſider of it. Firſt let them offer themſelues vpon their knees to God, firmely purpoſing to ſerue him all their life time in whatſoeuer ſtate he shall call them to. Hauing made that firme purpoſe, let them then pray to him to enlighten them, and to our B. Lady, their good Angell, and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular patrone to aſſiſt them in that worke, that they may know, and follow the will of God in it. Then they may examine their natural inclinations and complexion, and other circumſtances how they ſute with this or that ſtate. And it will not be amiſſe to thinke, that if they were then at the hower of their death what they would wish to haue choſen. Hauing weighed well all things, that which with moſt peace and quietnes offereth it ſelfe as beſt for them, that they may reſolue vpon, and

Heathens loue their wiues and husbands with a natural and rational loue: but Chriſtians being contracted by a Sacrament, muſt haue a higher loue, to wit ſacramental and gracious, for the loue of God, becauſe it is his will; otherwiſe it is but beaſtly, or at moſt a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane loue, ſuch as heathens haue, and will not laſt in them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are to marry muſt declare in three things. Firſt whether they haue made any vow inconſiſtent with marriage. Secondly whether they be not allready contracted with ſome other. Thirdly whether their marriage be with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents conſent? for they ought to haue at leaſt their interpretatiue conſent, as yong Toby had when by the Angels directions he was married without the knowledge of his parents; but not without their probable good liking of it. And as children in this owe a duety to their parents; ſoe it is fitting that parents should haue ſome reſpect to the affection and liking of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not to force them to marriages which they can not affect: for as marriages without conſent of parents; ſoe forced marriages haue ſeldome good ſucceſſe.</p>

               <p>The Romane Catechiſme aduiſeth here to warne the married, that vpon feſtiual dayes and in times of pennance they abſteine from the acts of matrimony. This is to be vnderſtoode by way of Councell, not of obligation. Yet it is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to be noted, and followed, as rendring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony more honourable betwixt them, when it is vſed in due circumſtances.</p>
               <p>I haue ſaid now all that I haue to ſay of the Sacraments. You haue ſeene in generall of them all, that they haue their power and effect through the merits of Chriſt, as iſſuing out of his bleſſed ſide vpon the Cros, and as the onely meanes of our ſanctification. With what deuotion then ought we to come to them.</p>
               <p>Thinke with thy ſelfe when thou goeſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any of the ſeauen Sacraments, that thou carrieſt then thy ſoule vnto Ieſus Chriſt to be washed in his blood; and although it were neuer ſoe ſicke, lame, or wounded; yet if thou commeſt worthily to any Sacrament he will turne vnto it take it into his hands, and cure it. Nay if the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoules could poſſibly receiue any Sacrament worthily, they should be freed out of hell by it; becauſe the merits of Chriſts Paſſion are infallibly applyed by any Sacrament worthily receiued. And in this conſiſteth the horrour of the damned, that they are not in ſtate, nor euer shall be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receiue the Sacraments of the Catholike Church. And this is our happines in this life, that allthough our ſinnes be neuer ſoe great; yet as long as we haue time to receiue the Sacraments, or onely, to deſire them for the loue of God, we
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:98706:209"/>may be freed from ſinne and ſanctifyed by them. But without them (at leaſt in deſire) we cannot be freed from mortall ſinne. For although by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition ſinnes may be forgiuen; yet that contrition includeth deſire of the Sacraments. Beſides that contrition is hard to be obtained. For the ſinner wounded by ſinne, and vnder the feete of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, held downe by his power, and by his owne euill inclinations, is eaſily kept in ſubiection, and hardly rizeth to that perfect loue of God, which contrition requireth; and therefor we haue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to helpe our weakeneſſe in that caſe, that if they haue but the feare of damnation and the loue of glory, and will apply a Sacrament to that feare and loue, it conteineth the vertue of Chriſts paſſion, and will ſoe cherish and ſtrengthen them, that allthough they were dead it would reuiue them to life. And therefor our bleſſed Sauiour breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon his diſciples ſaid, <hi>receiue ye the holy ghoſt</hi> to shew the power of the Sacraments in forgiuing of ſinnes. And at the reuiuing of Lazarus he weeped, groned in ſpirit, troubled himſelfe, prayed for him, and called vpon him with a lowd voice, to shew the horrible ſtate of men in mortall ſinne ſignifyed by Lazarus that was dead; and that ſoe we might eſteeme more of the Sacraments by which they are not onely reuiued againe, but ſoe highly honored as to become his beloued ſpouſes; euen as though ſome poore handmaid were taken out of ſlauery, and brought to the kings pallace to be made his wife. If thou doſt remember theſe things when thou goeſt to the Sacraments, that thou goeſt then to be clenſed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:98706:209"/>with the blood of Chriſt, and to be made the ſpouſe of God, thou wilt deteſt thy ſinnes with thy whole hart, and prepare thy ſelfe with much loue and deuotion to thy heauenly ſpouſe. And we muſt neuer come to the Sacraments vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we haue this preparation in our ſelues.</p>

            <p>The commandements are the law of God; and to ſay the law or the Commandements is the ſame thinge. For the Commandements (ſaith S.

Neither were the commandements deliuered to the Iſraelites ſoe much to let them know their obligation to them, as to make them remember it.

God commanded them and with his owne fingar hath printed them in the harts of all men, ſtriking reuerence vnto them, and a natural feare to breake them. And the more to augment that feare and reuerence in vs, he deliuered them after a moſt maieſtical and dreadfull manner to the Iſraelits. They were to prepare themſelues for three dayes before, to

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:98706:213"/>to doe things that were vnpoſſible to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and punished them for not doeing ſuch things, did he shew any loue to his maſter by ſpeaking ſoe of him?

               <p>It is indeede impoſſible for vs by nature one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without grace to kepe the Commandements ſoe, as to obtaine ſupernatural glory; but by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural grace it is not onely poſſible, but eaſy to obtaine that bleſſed ſtate, by keeping of the Commandements. God Commands vs noe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but to doe our endeauours to the fulfilling of the Commandements, he giueth grace to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke good our endeauours, and to fullfill them. It is as though a louing fathers hould commande his ſonne to cooperate with him in the doeing of ſomethinge which he will helpe to doe, and will doe chiefly himſelfe. Such a father is God to vs: he commandeth vs nothing but that to which he himſelfe will put his hand, and doe more in it then we doe. It is as when a new ſcholler is brought to a maſter to learne to write. The maſter biddeth him take his penne and write: and then taking him by the hand and guiding it, behold with his maſters helpe a faire letter is made, and his kind maſter giueth him a reward for that litle which he did, which was noe more but to permitte himſelfe to be guided by him. Such a maſter we haue of God: he requireth noe

Now if God giue grace for the performing of the Commandements, it is noe matter how hard they be in themſelues; for with his grace they are eaſy and light. S. Iohn.

But the Lord liueth that brought forth the children of Iſraël out of the Land of the North, and out of all the Lands to the which I did caſt them out. I will bring them againe into their Land which I gaue to their fathers. Behold I will ſend many fishers and they shall fish them.</hi> We are theſe Iſraëlits whom God hath fished by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which he ſent to draw vs out of the ſtate of idolatry; a darke, cold, and barren Land ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed by the North, and hath brought vs into the admirable light, and happy ſtate of the faith of Chriſt. The redemption out of Aegypt is not to be any more mentioned nor named a redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in compariſon of this. This we ought with gratitude to remember, and to loue and ſerue God hartily for it; becauſe by it he hath freed vs from hell. The words that follow are in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Commandement, by which the worship of ſtrange Gods is prohibited.</p>
               <p>The Commandements were deliuered in two tables: in the firſt were written the three firſt, which immediatly concerned the loue of God. In the ſecond the ſeauen laſt which concerne not ſoe immediatly the loue of God; but are with relation to our neighbour. But ſome louers of diuiſion will needs diuide the firſt Commandement into two, and breake the connexion which the doctors of the Church haue commonly acknowledged
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:98706:215"/>in them. They will haue the firſt to conteine all vnto the end of thoſe words. <hi>Thou shalt not haue ſtrange Gods before mee;</hi> and the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to beginne at the words following, and to conteine the forbidding of images and pictures; becauſe they thinke by this meanes to giue it more force againſt the auncient and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine, which alloweth them to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, as holy thinges; where it hath indeede noe force at all againſt it (as I shall preſently shew.) Onely obſerue here that it maketh noe more againſt images in two Commandements then in one, ſoe that we keepe the ſame words and their propper tranſlations (which not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe very men haue made bold to alter.) I remember that a Proteſtant freind of mine once obiected to mee that Catholiks had taken away one of the ten Commandements (meaning that we had put two into one) to mainteine our doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the worship of images. But thoſe that had ſoe poſſeſſed this ignorant man, had manifeſtly deceiued him; for the Catholike Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared nothing in this, but leaueth it indifferent to be vnderſtoode as one, or as two Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. That which the Catholike Church teacheth is that which the Holy Ghoſt ſaith;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.</note> and that is, that the Commandements are ten in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but to any particular manner of diuiding them the Church obligeth not. Thoſe that will diuide the firſt into two muſt take heed that they make not eleauen Commandements: and if to remedy this they shall ioyne the two laſt into one; then they fall into another inconuenience which
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:98706:215"/>is to make fower Commandements in the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſix onely in the ſecond; which is contrary to the commune and auncient manner of diuiding them, into three of the firſt table belonging to God and ſeauen of the ſecond table belonging to our neighbour, which S. Auguſtine approoueth of,
<note place="margin">

For that there is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nexion betwixt forbidding ſtrange Gods, and forbidding of grauen thinges to be adored and ſerued, then there is betwixt the deſire of adultery and the deſire of theft, as is manifeſt; they being in two deſtinct kindes of ſinne; and therfor with more reaſon shall be diuided into two Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements then the firſt. Thus much for the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou shalt not haue ſtrange Gods before mee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVorship of images.</note> Two things are here commanded: The one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue to wit to worship the true God: the other negatiue prohibiting the worship of falſe Gods. And although the ſecond be included in the firſt; becauſe the worship of the true God excludeth the worship of falſe Gods; yet becauſe the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits were a people prone to idolatry, and to liue in the midſt of Idolatrous nations; that they might not fall into that ſinne, as in the end they did, when Ieroboam, Achab, and other wicked kings pretended to worship the God of Iſrael, when they worshipped idols alſo; therefor they were not onely commanded to worship God; but alſo expreſly forbidden to worship ſtrange Gods. And by this we may vnderſtande the ſenſe of the words following <hi>thou shalt not make to thee a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thinge, nor any ſimilitude</hi> &amp;c. to be, that they
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:98706:216"/>should not make them to be adored, and ſerued as Gods;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sap.</hi> 13.</note> which the Gentil idolatours did, <hi>who haue called the works of mens hands Gods:</hi> and whom holy wiſdome in the ſame place reproou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for that <hi>either the fire, or the winde, or the ſwift ayre, or a circle of ſtarres, or exceeding much water, or the Sunne and the moone they thought to be Gods, rulers of the world.</hi> This was perfect idolatry: and this was that which God would here preuent in the Iſraelits: and by this the worship of images with inferiour onely, and not diuine worship, but as holy things, is not forbidden.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that the Iſraelits were commanded here, not onely not to worship images and pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res with diuine worship in themſelues, but alſo not to haue them amongſt them; it would make nothing againſt vs. Many things were forbidden them which are lawfull to vs: the circumſtances of that imperfect law, of that peoples weakneſſe, of thoſe times, and places, requiring it. They were forbidden to eate blood; becauſe they were of themſelues a bloody people: and in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times it was neceſſary to obſerue it as a praecept;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note> but now it is not. Certaine corporal clenſings were commanded them, and certaine creatures were forbidden to be eaten as vncleane; and theſe were neither obſerued in the Apoſtles times, nor are now. Images and pictures in thoſe idolatrous times might be forbidden them to haue, for their proneneſſe to idolatry; but the Apoſtles had them, and we haue them, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them as holy thinges in the law of Chriſt; which was to be, and hath bene as we ſee, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:98706:216"/>of idolatry. That which the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments oblige vnto by obligation of nature, that we, and all people are bounde to obſerue; but that which they commande as propper to the Iſraelits onely, obligeth not vs. He therefor, that would make a good argument againſt our worship of images muſt prooue that it is forbidden either by ſome particular praecept propper to vs, or by a natural praecept commune to all; but this none can euer prooue. As for any particular praecept propper to vs, there is none can or doth offer to produce any praecept by which images are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be worshipped particularly by chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And for any general praecept forbidding by nature the worship of images, as holy thinges, it is contrary to reaſon, to the ſcriptures, to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels, and to the practiſe of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and preſent Church.</p>
               <p>Natural reaſon and order requireth that euery thinge be honored according to its natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. God is to be worshipped as God with ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and diuine worship primely in himſelfe; and creatures with inferiour worship according to their nature, as they haue more or leſſe relation to God. We giue ciuill honour to one another, and eſpecially to our ſuperiors, as hauing a neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er relation to him that is ſupreme; and we giue religious worship to holy things, as they haue more or leſſe relation to him. Images then hauing a particular relation to God by the holy things which they repreſent, are to be worshipped with a holy and religious worship: natural reaſon teaching that when we worship any thinge, we
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:98706:217"/>should worship that alſo which hath relation vnto it; becauſe in reſpect of it, and for its ſake it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth alſo ſome worship; and therefor we loue all that haue relation to our freinds, and worship our ſuperiors for Gods ſake, whom they repreſent. We are not then forbidden by any praecept of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to worship images with a ſecondary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue worship: but we are taught by natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that as they haue relation to the holy things which they repreſent, they are to be worshipped with a holy and religious worship, though rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely and ſecondarily onely; the goodnes of the thinge repreſented being the prime motiue of that worship. And this is confirmed for that all men by nature apprehende the iniurys done to the images of their enemys, as done to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys themſelues, the prototypes of thoſe images; and therfor by the ſame reaſon we muſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that the worship which we giue to the images of our freinds, as to Crucifixes, holy pictures, and the like is giuen to the prototype repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. Therefor images are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with ſecondary and relatiue worship for the prototypés ſake, which is primely and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally worshipped in them.</p>
               <p>That which the Catholike Church doth in this is commended all ouer in the ſcriptures: the arke, the temple, the veſſell and ornaments of it, the prieſts garments, and the like, being to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with inferiour religious worship for the relation which they had to God. They prayed towards the temple in reuerence to it, the veſſel of it were not to be touched with vnconſcerated
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:98706:217"/>hands. The ground on which Moyſes ſaw that great viſion was called holy,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.</note> and as ſuch was to be honored with his bare feete when he trode on it, onely in relation to the viſion that appeared to him in that place. Make then this argument, That which hath relation to holy things is holy, and to be worshipped in that relation: images and pictures haue relation to holy things; therefor they are holy and to be worshipped in it. But it diſpleaſeth the enemys of the Catholike Church to haue it called adoring of images. This ought not to diſpleaſe them; for creatures are often ſaid in the ſcriptures to be adored. Abraham being amongſt the Hethaits lawfully <hi>adored before the people of the Land.</hi> Iacob adored Eſau,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.</note> and Eſau adored him againe, Ioſeph adored Iacob, Dauid adored Saul, the Prophet Nathan adored Dauid and we are commanded pſal. 98. to adore the footſtoole of God: which muſt be vnderſtoode of ſome creature in relation to him. And if all this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy not, let them agree with vs that images and pictures, as they haue relation to holy things, are to be honored, and for the name, let them call it reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, honour, worship, or the like, as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The Catholike doctrine in this was aunciently queſtioned by haeretiks; but is was declared by the Councell of Nyce againſt them, and thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed that should deny it. The Apoſtles in their canons haue commended the vſe of images and pictures to vs, and the fathers in their writings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue declared them to haue bene vſed in their times, as now they are in the Catholike Church. S.

Chryſoſtome in his Lyturgy, <hi>the prieſt coms forth carrying the ghoſpell, with the Clerke before him, hauing a light, and turning to the image of Chriſt he bendeth his head.</hi> What more could we haue deſired them to ſay? Was it now truely ſaid of Caluin that for the firſt fiue hundred yeares after Chriſt, images were not worshiped, theſe Saints hauing liued farre with in that time? Or is it true that which our enemys make their people to beleeue, that we committe idolatry by it, giuing diuine honour to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>The contrary is an auncient hereſy noted in Marcyon, Manichaeus, Xenaias, and others, who were then recorded as haeretiks for it: and the wicked Iulian as he Apoſtatized from the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith denying his chriſtendome; ſoe did he alſo deny to worship the holy images, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the myſterys of that faith; and pulling downe that which the pious woman whom Chriſt cured of the blody flux had erected of him, and which for ſome hundreds of yeares vntill his reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne had bene reuerenced by chriſtians, he ſet vp, his owne inſteede of it: but the diuine indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quickly appeared againſt his prophaneſſe: fire deſcending from heauen, and breaking it in peeces, diuided the head from the shoulders of the image of that wicked man.

And that a painter being ſent by the king to bring him at leaſt the liuely countenance of him, when he should haue drawne his picture, the brightneſſe of his face did ſoe dazle the painters eyes, that he could not goe on with his worke.

This is recorded by diuerſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Euagrius mentioneth the miracles which were wrought by that picture. For what end now did Chriſt thus draw this miraculous pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and ſend it to the king? Was it to be cut in peeces and abuſed as haeretiks doe the pictures of him? or els to be kept and honored for his ſake? Truely as it was the picture of Chriſt whom he loued and worshipped, he could not in reaſon but loue and worship it: and if he had done otherwiſe, he had not shewed himſelfe the freind of Chriſt. The worship of images is not then forbidden by nature; but is grounded vpon the nature of images and of our nature, who are to worship holy hings. And ſuch worship is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as you haue ſeene from the Scriptures, warranted by Councels, and by practiſe of the primitiue Church, and by miracles; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for whatſoeuer obiections that can be made againſt it muſt either be (as they are) vaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, or plane forgerys of contentious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſembling men.</p>

                  <hi>Thou shalt ſweare our Lord liueth, in truth and in iudgment, and in iuſtice.</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:98706:220"/>The firſt condition is verity, that it be true that which we call God to be the witneſſe of. The ſecond is that it muſt be alſo with iudgement, and not rashly and inconſideratly, as ſome doe vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friuolous occaſion, abuſing the holy name and maieſty of God. This is a very great irreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: For if it be an irreuerence to a king or great perſonage to be called as witneſſe of triuial, and friuolous things of noe moment, as of killing of flyes, or picking of ſtrawes, much more is it againſt the diuine maieſty to be called rashly, and indiſcretly as a witneſſe, without neceſſity. The third condition is iuſtice, that it be iuſt and lawfull that which we promiſe and ſweare to. This condition was wanting in Herods oth, who hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſworne to the daughter of Herodias to grant her whatſoeuer she should aske, and she asking the head of S.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:98706:221"/>would take this oth they should haue their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deliuered to them. The firſt thinge which the Catholike Bishops did was to make a reſolute and vnanimous profeſſion of their faith. They ſent therefor to the king in theſe words <hi>We haue allwais ſaid, and now ſay, and will allwais ſay, we are bishops, we are chriſtians, we all hold one true and Apoſtolical faith.</hi> But as for the oth, ſome of them were of minde to take it, hauing a ſcruple of their Churches being otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from them; others fearing ſome deceit in the buſines, excuſed themſelues with the words of Chriſt <hi>I ſay to you not to ſweare at all.</hi> But in fine they were all to be banished. thoſe that would take the oth as men of noe conſcience that would ſweare to any thinge; and thoſe that would not, becauſe they loued not the king.

               <p>It is not onely vnlawfull to take the name of God in vaine; but alſo to ſweare by his creatures.

Baſe minded men, who becauſe they ſee the patience of God with ſinners, that preſently he ſtriketh them not, they contemne him: and where as they flatter men and giue faire words to their enemys for feare, they rize vp againſt God with oths cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and blaſphemys, as though they would fight, and be reuenged of him.

               <p>That which is propper to this ſinne is to harden the hart more then other ſinnes doe, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe that vſe it to all other ſinnes: for as it hath a vaine and ſeeming brauery in the opinion of foolish men; ſoe they take more complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and continuelonger in it euen to the hardening of their harts ſoe, that they haue almoſt noe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the offence of God.

For that child was but fiue yeares old, and I know not whether he were capable of ſinne or noe.

                  <hi>REMEMBER thou ſanctify the Sabaoth day.</hi> The word <hi>Sabaoth</hi> ſignifyeth <hi>Reſt:</hi> and ſoe the Sabaoth day is as much as to ſay a day of reſt, in which we are to reſt from labour. Here then we are commanded to ſanctify to God a day of reſt, that abſteining from corporal works, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende vnto acts of religion, and diuine worship. This is an obligation which all haue by nature; that as all times were created, and ordained for the ſeruice of God; ſoe ſome dayes should be particularly obſerued in honour of him. But we are not by nature bounde to obſerue any one day more then another: for that was to be determined by the Church, which is directed by the Holy Ghoſt to order all according to conuenient cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. And ſoe the Church of the Iſraelits was commanded to obſerue the ſeauenth day, on which God reſted from the creation of the world: and the Church of Chriſt is directed to keepe the next day after it, in remembrance of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſauiour, and of the comming of the Holy Ghoſt: both which myſterys happened on the next day after the Iewish Sabaoth, and on that day which we call <hi>Sunday,</hi> and which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call the <hi>Dominical day,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Our Lords day.</hi> Thus the Sabaoth day was transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the next day by the ſame authority that firſt commanded it: and was kept by the Apoſtles on the ſame day on which we keepe it; as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>By the Sabaoth all holy dayes are here vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode.

The feaſt of Azyme or Paſch was the cheife, Then the feaſt of Pentecoſt. Thirdly the feaſt of Tabernacles in remembrance of God praeſeruing them after their comming out of Aegypt for forty yeares in taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles. Beſides theſe, they had alſo diuerſe other leſſer feaſts, as of the New moones, &amp;c. but the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe were the cheife, and ſoe ſolemne, that they were kept with octaues, and all the male people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Maldonate was to be at them. but now as shaddows their feaſts are paſſed away,

The other prayers of the Church, as being much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the maſſe; and ſermon which is inferiour to the prayers of the Church, oblige not all vnder a mortal ſinne to be preſent at them. Yet of deuotion, it is ſitting that all should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent alſo at thoſe holy ſeruices of God, which are to be preferred before any priuate deuotions of our owne. Beſides we shew more loue by thoſe works of ſupererogation, a good ſeruant will not expect to be commanded to euery thinge, but of his owne accord will doe that which he ſeeth to conduce vnto his maſters profit. After euenſong honeſt and modeſt recreations are not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, thoſe that haue labored hard all the weeke had neede of ſome time of recreation to refresh themſelues; and honeſt recreations may either lawfully be taken then, or els they can neuer be had. Thoſe that are ſoe praeciſe to the contrary (as ſome hypocrytical ſpirits of theſetimes haue bene) commande they know not what, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:98706:224"/>burdens which if themſelues were to carry after a whole weeks labour, they would not touch with their fingar. God may be honored in ſuch recreations, and the ſeruants of God know how to honour him in them.</p>
               <p>It is a great wickedneſſe in many who inſteede of ſanctifying of holydaies with good works, and abſteining from ſinne, make them the commune dayes of ſinne, prophaning them with new and more greeuous ſinnes committed on them. This is a circumſtance at leaſt fitting (if not abſolutly neceſſary) to be expreſſed in confeſſion. For as it were a circumſtance of higher malice for a ſubiect to ſtrike at the king, and to attempt to kill him on ſome ſolemne day in which he were reioycing in the midſt of his people, and comforting them with his gracious and glorious aſpect; ſoe it is a great ſinne and heinous malice in a chriſtian to giue himſelfe to vice vpon holydayes, and as it were to committe treaſon againſt God, when his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants are gathered together to praiſe and bleſſe him.</p>

               <p>Here we are to ſpeake both of the duety of children, and of parents. For as children owe a duety to their parents; ſoe parents owe their duety to God, as his children. Children are to loue, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and obey their parents, and to releeue them in their needes: and parents are to inſtruct and correct their children, and to prouide for their mainteinance. Children muſt loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence their parents in their harts, and muſt ſpeake well of them, and loue to heare them well ſpoken of, and performe ſubmiſſiuely all thoſe filiall reſpects which children vſe to their parents.

They muſt obey them willingly, and haue their conſent in thoſe thinges that concerne their courſe of life; knowing that it is a mortal ſinne in things lawfull, and of moment, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them.

               <p>As for the duety of parents to God, they are to loue their children, not for themſelues, but for Gods ſake: they are to inſtruct them or to ſee that they be inſtructed in their prayers, chriſtian doctrine, and good life: in which there is a great negligence in ſome parents. The loue of parents to their children ought I ſay to be for Gods ſake, and not as ſome who are ſoe immoderate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the loue of them, that indeede they make fooles of them, for want of inſtruction and dew correcting of their falts.

Iſrael being worſted in batle by the Philiſtaeans, ſent for the arke of our Lord into the campe amongſt them, and receiued it with ſuch showtes and acclamations of ioy, that the earth rang with the ſounde of their cry, and their enemys were terrifyed to heare it. Great then were the hopes of Iſrael, and their expectation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day. The day of batle was come and Heli not being able to be preſent himſelfe at the fight, for that he was almoſt a hundred yeares old, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſtoole to be ſett ouer againſt the way, and ſatt him downe on it to expect the newſe of their good ſucceſſe. A meſſenger com's faſt enough with ill newſe, and letteth him know that Iſrael was put to flight, a great ruine was made of the people, his two ſonnes were ſlaine, and that (which was worſt of all) the arke of God was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the enemy. With all which the old mans hart was ſoe ſurcharged, that his ſtrength beganne to faile, his ſpirits to faint, and by litle and litle quite forſaking him, he fell backwards ouer and broke his necke. A pittifull ſpectacle to behold the moſt venerable perſonage of all Iſrael, the high Prieſt and Prince of that people, to ly in that poſture dead with ſorrow. And this imputed byau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to noe other ſinne in him, but to too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence towards his children. This is a loue which beſide the hurt which childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiue by it, hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much the loue of God in parents, diuerting their mindes from him, and as it were turning him out of poſſeſſion, who ought to poſſeſſe the centre

The loue which parents ought to haue of their children ought to be gracious and orderly for the loue and honour of God; and of ſuch loue they may haue as much as they can: but to preferre the loue of kindred before God is diſorderly, and vnworthy of a chriſtian.

If we ſaw two companys, the

                  <hi>THOV shalt not committe adultery.</hi> As there is not any thinge which marryed folkes may challenge more iuſtly of one another, then loue and fidelity; ſoe there is nothing which they ought to diſdaine more then adultery, by which that truſt and fidelity is broken betwixt them. When they were marryed they betrothed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to each other, promiſing perpetuall loue, and euerlaſting loyalty, as two in one body, and one hart. This promiſe of loyalty which was then
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:98706:232"/>ſolemnely made betwixt them, ſealed by a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deliuered into the hands of God, is moſt treacherouſly violated by adultery. Let the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor thoſe that are married vnderſtande the greeuouſnes of this ſinne, as quite oppoſite to the perfection of their ſtate, and ſignification the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of; which is the inſeperable loue and vnion of Chriſt with the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>In this Commandement all carnal ſinnes are vnderſtoode as forbidden by the name of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Fornication which is with a ſingle perſon, Deſlouring which is with a virgin, Inceſt which is with ones owne kinred, Sacrilege with a ſacred perſon. All which are of ſeueral kindes and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er malice, and therefor to be deſtinguished, and particularly expreſſed in confeſſion. Carnal ſinnes are communely called in English Beaſtly ſinnes; and they may well be ſoe called: for by them eſpecially, men become like vnto beaſts, following onely their owne appetite and ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is moſt ſordid and brutish And although theſe beaſtly ſinnes at firſt be purſued with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and remorſe of conſcience; yet if they be often committed, and not preſently repented for, they make men to become euen quite Brutish without any regard of God: that the Prophet ſaith, <hi>fornication and drunkenneſſe take away the hart.</hi>

               <p>We haue the vertue of chaſtity by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples commended vnto vs, eſpecially in the law of grace.

His Apoſtles obſerued chaſtity and commended it to their diſciples to be obſerued by them. And we haue many examples of holy men and women that haue followed them in it both in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue times, and euer ſince, ſufficient to inflame the harts of good Catholiks with the loue of it, and to prooue chaſtity to be a vertue not ſoe hard to be obtained, as ſome vncleane ſpirits of theſe latter times would perſwade the world. Diuerſe holy men haue kept continent from their wiues
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:98706:233"/>and liued not as their huſbands, but as their brothers; Not in ſenſible but inuincible by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of carnality, which through care and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy they ſtill ouercame.</p>

Such is the rewarde which God giueth to his ſeruants for one ſuch combate valiantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, and victory atheiued by them.

Hierome mentioneth epiſt. <hi>de vita Pauli:</hi> Who hauing ouercome many cruell torments his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys reſolued at laſt to aſſalt him by faire meanes, and to attempt him by carnall ſinnes. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him into a ſweet and pleaſant garden, laid him there in a bedde of feathers, ſtrowed with roſes, and delicious flowers, neere vnto a riuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; where the beauty of the place, fresh ayre, and pleaſant noyſe of the riuer might inuite him to delight: and that he should not fly the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they bounde him downe with ſoft skarfes of ſilke; and being thus bounde they ſent vnto him, a shameleſſe harlot to tempt him. O God free thy ſeruant in this exceſſe of temptation.

He commanded a certaine graue perſon to affront and abuſe him by euill words, and as ſoone as he had done, to come firſt, and to make his complaint againſt him. Witneſſes alſo being called, they all ſpoke againſt the yong man. At which he was ſoe much perplexed that he neuer ceaſed to complaine to himſelfe, hauing none to take his part, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that his Superiour would ſeeme ſometimes, as it is were to defende him: and hauing permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to paſſe a whole yeare in this perplexity, and vexation of minde he asked him then how he felt himſelf for carnall temptations. Father (quoth he) I am weary of my life, and am I likely to take any pleaſure in thoſe thoughts?

But now we will ſpeake of that which it hath in particular, as its proper and peculiar fruit.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that by prayer we keepe our harts in humility and ſubmiſſion to God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:98706:247"/>by our prayers, that he is the ſupreme power and high perfection from whence all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits proceed: and that we depending of him as his creatures,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 8.</note> come for ſuccour and releife to him: and therefore S. Iohn ſaw the prayers of the Saints, as incenſe, which was to be offered on the Altare, and the Catholike Church prayeth with the holy King ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 440.</note> 
                  <hi>Let my prayer be directed as incenſe in thy ſight.</hi> Becauſe it is a kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour ſacrifice, and hath the effect of it to doe homage vnto God, and to keepe vs in humility towards him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond fruit of prayer is that it pacifyeth the diuine wrath prouoked by ſinne. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the prayers of a ſinner, as long as he is in mortal ſinne, haue noe proportion to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſinnes, or to the releaſing of his punishment; yet it is congruous and moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the infinite goodneſſe and liberality of God, that he should accept of the endeauours of our nature, and should grant vs his grace for ſuch endeauours; and ſoe ſinners that are out of the ſtate of grace, obtaine grace of congruity, by praying for it. But the prayer of the iuſt is ſoe powerfull that after a certaine manner it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth God as it were by violence to grant that which he deſireth, and holdeth his hands from punishing of others. Euen as ſtrong dammes, well fortifyed with ſtone and timber, reſiſt huge inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of waters, and ſuport their mighty weight, ſoe the prayer of the iuſt reſiſt the wrath of God and beare of the weight of his indignation from ſinners. This is expreſſed in the words of God to
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:98706:248"/>Moyſes when Iſrael had adored the molten calfe, and the diuine indignation was comming as a torrent to ſweepe them quite away from the face of the earth the prayers of Moyſes had ſuch power to withſtande it that God ſaid Exod. 23. <hi>Suffer me that my fury may be angry againſt them,</hi> as though he had held him by force from deſtroying them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly as I ſaid before of ſinners that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their ſinnes and punishments are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as it were by violence, when the iuſt pray for them; ſoe alſo we may ſay of all others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; for that the goodnes and liberality of God is ſuch that he is forced as it were to grant all, and can deny nothing which is worthily asked of him. This he would shew euen in the granting of a temporall benefit at the prayers of Ioſue, when the Iſraelits wanting day to purſue the victory; Ioſue praying commanded the Sunne and Moone to ſtande ſtill;; and they ſtoode ſtill till the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reuenged themſelues of their enemys. And to shew how powerfull the prayer of the iuſt is, the Holy Ghoſt would make ſo remarkeable an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as to ſay that God obeyed the voice of a man, as though Ioſue by his prayers had had God at obedience. And although heauen be gained as well by all good workes, as by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

               <head>OF THE PREPARATION TO PRAYER.</head>
               <p>THAT we may pray with profit,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 18.</note> and reape the fruite of prayer, we muſt prepare our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues duely to it. <hi>Before prayer prepare thy ſoule,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt. The firſt and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary preparation is to bee cleere from mortall ſinne. For prayer which is made in mortall ſinne hath but litle force, and noe condignity at all to the obtaining of ſupernatural gifts, which muſt proceed from the diuine grace. And therefor he that will pray effectually, muſt firſt make cleere his conſcience by a good confeſſion; that being reſtored to the grace of God, his prayer may be acceptable to him. But if he haue not the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a Confeſſour, let him in the meane time make an act of contrition, which may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply confeſſion vntill it can be had: and let him pray for contrition, and for a fitt diſpoſition for prayer: as the man of the Ghoſpell,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc</hi> 9.</note> who when Chriſt required of him to beleeue, he ſaid. <hi>I doe beleeue Lord: help my incredulity.</hi> Soe may the ſinner endeauour before prayer to make an act of contrition, and pray for that which is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him. The Publican was a ſinner when he began to pray, but praying with humility and ſorrow, he obtained the remiſſion of his ſinnes, when ſtanding a farre of,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 18.</note> and knocking of his breaſt, he prayed, <hi>God be mercifull to mee a ſinner.</hi> By his ſtanding a farre of his humility, by the knocking of his breaſt, and the words
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:98706:249"/>which he ſpoke, his great ſorrow is denored; and by ſo praying (although he were at firſt a ſinner) yet by prayer he obtained contrition, and by contrition his ſinnes were forgiuen,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10.</note> and he went away iuſtifyed. So Cornelius the Centurion pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gaue almes: and although then as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, he were out of the ſtate of grace: yet by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual prayer (for the Euangeliſt commendeth him as <hi>allways praying to God</hi>) he obtained the viſion of an Angell, and S. Peter was ſent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten him with the Faith of Chriſt. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are out of the ſtate of grace, and haue not the opportunity of confeſſion, let them pray for contrition, and endeauour to ſtirre vp in themſelues a true and feruerous loue of God. Wicked Antiochus was grieued at his ſinnes, or rather at his punishments, and although he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the truth, that they came from God; yet it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mach</hi> 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>He prayed to our Lord of whom he was not to obtaine mercy:</hi> becauſe he was not truely penitent, nor ſought the honour of God, but his owne eaſe only by prayer.</p>
               <p>The next preparation to prayer is to come with much humility and reuerence, conſidering who it is to whom we are going to ſpeake, and who we are that are admitted to ſpeake. It is God to whom we ſpeake. God the Lord of Heauen and Earth, that made vs of noe better thing then the ſlime of the earth, a peece of dead clay, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life and giuing reaſon to it: and that peece of earth being thus framed of God, hath rebelled againſt him, and abuſed his maker; and euen then not being quite free from ſinne, is permitted
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:98706:249"/>neuertheles to appeare in his ſight and to petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccli.</hi> 35.</note> 
                  <hi>The prayer of him that humbleth himſelfe shall penetrate the clowdes.</hi> Thus did holy Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham pray with humility, ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſpeake to my Lord where as I am duſt and ashes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly we muſt pray with much loue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the goodnes and bounty of God. We may conſider then that he is (as he is indeede) our father, allwais deſiring our good, and that he is infinitly liberall of all thoſe things which he knoweth to be good for vs; and that we will kneele downe to him, as a louing and gracious child would doe to his father, to aske bleſſings of him; and that we will aske with confidence that which is neceſſary for vs, and will obey him. Thus the holy King prepared himſelfe with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, loue, and confidence, and then powred forth his prayer in the ſight of God. Let vs then remember to prepare ourſelues to prayer with theſe three things. Firſt with a cleere conſcience by confeſſion or contrition. Secondly with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reuerence to God. Thirdly with loue and confidence in him. Let vs ſee now</p>

               <p>We pray for all men, becauſe we are bounde to deſire the good of all as our neighbors. But of all men we pray eſpecially for the Catholike Church, and of the Catholike Church we pray eſpecially for the Popes holines, as the head of the Church.

Our prayers indeede may be called and are a kind of ſacrifice; becauſe we either expreſly confeſſe the ſupreme power of God, or implicitly acknowledge it by all prayers. The prayers which we make immediatly to God are a kind of Sacrifice; becauſe by them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:98706:251"/>and directly we acknowledge his ſupreme, and diuine power. The prayers which we make by the mediation of the Saints are alſo ſacrifices in their kind, becauſe mediatly and indirectly they acknowledge the ſame, in that finally they tende vnto God, by the Saints praying to him, as we deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. The prayers which we make to Saints are a kind of ſacrifice as they tende vnto God; as they te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints, they are not ſacrifices, becauſe they acknowledge not the ſupreme and diuine power to be in them.</p>
               <p>It was an auncient hereſy in the primitiue Church to deny the inuocation of Saints, mainteined by vigilantius and other haeretiks,

Firſt this argument is turned backe vpon themſelues. If Chriſt be our mediatour and aduocate, it is not then iniurious to God nor derogating from his liberality, to make vſe of a mediatour and aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate (as they ſaid before that it was.) The words therefor alleadged make nothing againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine, nor are here applyed to good purpoſe, nor in their true ſenſe: for the Apoſtles ſpeake there of the mediation of Chriſt by way of redemption; and ſoe Chriſt is our onely media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and aduocate, becauſe he onely in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation of his paſſion redeemed vs, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:98706:253"/>and Saints redeemed vs not.

               <p>Hence the Catholike doctrine is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.

And ſome ſinnes there are which hinder more then others: theſe are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe which are more oppoſit to charity towards our neighbour: as hatred and rancour of hart, and hardhartednes againſt the poore. How
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:98706:257"/>can that man pray to God to be forgiuen by him when he beareth in his minde a grudge againſt his neighbour, and will not forgiue him? he keepeth in his hart an iniury as he conceiueth, yet he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O ſpitefull hart thou contradicteſt in thy minde that which thou ſayeſt in words, as though thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſſemble with God. Thou pretendeſt with thy mouth, and kneeleſt downe as if thou would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and in thy hart thou art meditating a miſcheife to his ſeruant. <hi>When you shall ſtretch forth your hads I will turne a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and when you shall multiply prayer I will not heare for your hands are full of blood,</hi> ſaith God by his Prophet. If a wicked murderer that had killed the ſeruant of ſome Prince, should runne to his maſter, and should hold vp his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſmoking with his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts warme blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were he likely to obtaine pardon no certainly, he should rather moue him to more horrour againſt him, and for his bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to ſend him away preſently to be hanged vp in chaines Thus malicious ſpirits and reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full harts come to their prayers, and hold vp their hands bloody with deſire of reuenge againſt their neighbour. It was directly to this purpoſe that which S.

And thoſe that haue not much to giue let them giue a little willingly.</p>
               <p>The ſecond impediment in the obtaining of our prayers may bee our vndue and vnworthy manner of praying, that we pray not with due reuerence and attention. For this we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider diuerſe ſorts of attention in prayer. Firſt there is attention to the words, that we miſſe none
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:98706:258"/>of them. Secondly attention to the ſenſe of the words, that we vnderſtand them as we pray. Both which attentions are good; but there is a third much better then they; and that is attention to the preſence of God, and to the thing which we pray for. That we proſtrate ourſelues with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and humility before him, and deſire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly that which we aske of him. This attention may be had by of thoſe that vnderſtande not the words of their prayers: and therefor they are not to be reprche<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that ſay their <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and other prayers in Latine, although they vnderſtande them not For it is not the vnderſtanding but the aflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God regardeth moſt in prayer. Ignorant men preſenting their petitions to the King bring many words in them, which themſelues vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande not, and ſometimes the whole petition in a language which they haue no skill of; yet they obtaine their deſire: and if the King ſaw the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their harts, as God doth, and the great reuerence which they beare vnto him, and their feruours and earneſt deſire of obtaining, he would without doubt he much moued by it to grant their petition. It was to this purpoſe that which Chriſt ſaid to the Samaritan woman.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Io.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The houre commeth and now it is when the true adorers shall adore the Father in ſpirit and verity. For the Father ſeeketh ſuch to adore him.</hi> That is to ſay in the law of grace which commeth and now is, the true adorers shall worship God ſpiritually more then in the law of Moyſes, which conſiſted rather of corporal ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifications, and outward ceremonies then of ſpirituall grace which is giuen in the faith of
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:98706:258"/>Chriſt. Our prayers then that are ſanctifyed by the law of Chriſt ought to be with much fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of ſpirit, more cordiall then verball: and the more cordiall that they are, the more ſuetable they are to that law. Therefor to praye well and efficaciouſly, wee ought to pray with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and attention to the preſence of God and to the thing which we pray for, deſiring it with much earneſtnes all the time that we pray.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the inconuenience of the thing which we pray for is oftentimes a hinderance to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it; becauſe we ſee not the contingencys and circumſtances of future things we aske ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we know not what: that which is both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient in it ſelfe, and may be hurtfull to vs. As when lames and Iohn came vnto Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 10.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Maſter we will that what thing ſoeuer we shall aske thou doe it to vs,</hi> and then they asked to ſit one on his right hand, and the other on his left in his Kingdome. But he told them, <hi>you wott not what you aske.</hi> So the ſame Apoſtles ſeeing Chriſt hindered to enter into a city of Samaria tooke ſuch a diſdaine againſt thoſe that hindered him, that they were preſently about bringing of fire from heauen to conſume them:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 9.</note> but Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them, ſaying, <hi>you know not of what ſpirit you are.</hi> They asked that which was inconuenient. And Peter asked that which was hurtfull, when being enamoured with the glory of Chriſts trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration he deſired to ſtay in that manner with him for euer. Here <hi>he knew not what he ſaid:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 9.</note> and when Chriſt was foretelling the miſtery of his Paſſion, Peter could not endure to heare of it;
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:98706:259"/>but diſſwaded him from it deſiring that which was hurtfull both to himſelfe and to all mankind in the hinderance of Chriſts ſuffering; and therefor his maſter rebuked him, ſaying, <hi>Goe after mee Satan thou art a ſcandall to mee.</hi> God sheweth his loue as much in denying our prayers when they are hurtfull, as in granting them when they are profitable to vs; and therefore we ought to be as well contented with the one, as with the other, and neuer to repine at the not obtaining of our prayers: For if we haue not our deſire we haue that which is better for vs. If we were hindered by a freind for taking of countrefeit gold inſteed of true, or from drinking of poyſon inſteed of good drinke, had we not good reaſon to thanke him for it? He that reflecteth vpon the paſſages which haue happened to him, and obſerueth diligently how he hath obtained, or not obtained his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, shall ſee without doubt, and in his hart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the manifeſt prouidence of God in denying himſome things which he hath prayed for. This I thanke God I haue often ſeene in my ſelfe, and found by experience that ſometimes I haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be freed from ſome dangers, when if I had had my deſire, I had manifeſtly incurred farre greater, which none but God could foreſee and preuent. And once in my youth by my earneſt prayers eſpecially by the interceſſion of S Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius of Loyola, whoſe aſſiſtance I particularly then implored, I was ſtrangely freed from a very great affliction which troubled mee. But after a while it returned againe vnto mee, and that to my great good, as ſince I haue perceiued, and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:98706:259"/>haue often acknowledged the goodneſſe of God both in taking it away to shew the power of his Saint, and in reſtoring it againe, it being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for mee. The liberality of God is infinite, and and his care neuer faileth towards vs, but he will grant our petitions as they are conuenient, and will not make vſe of our ignorance to hurt vs, nor always grant that which we thinke, but that which he knoweth to be good for vs.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore in breife are the cheife hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances from obtaining of our prayers. The ſinnes which we are guilty of, hardnes of hart againſt our enemys, and againſt the poore, want of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and attention at our prayers, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience of that which we pray for. Hauing ſaid thus much of prayer in general, let vs now declare the petitions of the <hi>Pater Noſter.</hi>

                  <hi>OVR Father which art in Heauen: Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> The firſt words, <hi>Our Father which art in Heauen.</hi> are an exordium of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, reuerence, and confidence which we vſe to God. He is our father in many reſpects. Firſt as we haue our being from our fathers: ſo we haue it more principally from him, who gaue being both to vs, and our fathers. Secondly, God is our father in his care and prouidence ouer vs. He ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs as Pilgrims, to trauail in this world, but he committeth vs as his children to the Angels of his Court, to be as our Tutors, to guard, and protect vs. Holy Tobias was a good father to his ſonne,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:98706:260"/>when ſending him a dagerous iourney he thought of ſome carefull man to be his guide: but God was a better father to him, who ſent an Angell to guide him, and to deliuer him out of thoſe da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers out of which no man could haue deliuered him. This father of ours had but one onely naturall ſonne and deſiring to adopte vs for his children he ſent that onely ſonne to redeeme vs, and to giue his life as the price of our ranſome:

For this is the firſt and cheife good, and the principall thing which wee are to deſire and pray for, that God may haue that honour which is due to him. We aske in this petition that the externall honour of God may increaſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt his creatures: (for his intrinſecall honour and perfections are infinite and increaſe not) and that his true worship may be knowne, and giuen him by the enemys of the Catholike Faith, and that Catholiks may liue according to the holines of their profeſſion. But how farre are we from the performance of this prayer? Thoſe that in words ſay hallowed be thy Name,

The ignorance of our vnderſtandings neuer hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our ſoules, but when it is voluntary, and all our ſinnes proceede from thence, that either we will not doe what we know is to be done, or will not know what we are to doe.

               <p>By bread all corporal neceſſarys are here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. For foode being the moſt neceſſary of all corporal thinges, and bread-being the moſt neceſſary of all foodes, it may properly ſignify all temporall neceſſarys: and therefor in the holy ſcriptures bread is taken generally for any kind of meate, as in the place aboue cited, where la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob prayed for bread and rayment: and Luc. 14. where it is ſaid that Chriſt entred <hi>into the houſe of a certaine Prince of the Phariſys to eate bread.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.</note> That is to ſay to eate meate in general; for it was a feaſt which the Phariſee then made for his freinds.</p>
               <p>Here we may conceiue ſomethinge of the great loſſe which we haue incurred by ſinne. Man whilſt he was in paradiſe, and in ſtate of grace, was well prouided for of all corporal thinges; the tree of life ſupplying him ſoe, that he could feare noe want. But falling into ſinne he fell into feare and shame, and beganne to want meate and cloths, and many other things, and was glad to take paines, and to worke hard to get that which he ſtoode nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of: and for all his paines taking is ſtill in feare of want; and therefor we are taught here to humble ourſelues to God, and to pray to him to bleſſe our labors, and to giue fruit to them; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:98706:264"/>are vaine and fruitleſſe: and to shew this he ſendeth ſometimes exceſſe of heates, colds, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, droughts, inundations and the like, by which he deminisheth our allowance, and taketh as much as he will from vs. What a folly then is it in rich and worldly men for the loue of riches, or for any worldly reſpect to forſake God, and to ſinne againſt him? If God should blaſt their corne burne their graſſe, ſend diſeaſes to their goods, fire to their houſes, or ſome greeuous lameneſſe, or deformity to their perſons, what would they doe then? Iob was rich enough, and had honour enough as a prince. Yet he came to looſe all, and to be in great want, and ſuch miſery, as to ly vpon a dunghill, and to ſcrape away the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from his body with shells, and ſuch things as he founde beſide him. This would God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte in him, to shew that all our felicitys are in his hands, and that their is none rich and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous but by him. And becauſe he tooke all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and remained ſtill the ſeruant of God, he was bleſſed againe with temporal proſperity double to that which before he enioyed. Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus was a king farre greater then Iob; yet leſſe then God, who for his pride and cruelty, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed his armys and brought him to that miſery, that as holy Scripture ſaith <hi>he that ſeemed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to rule euen ouer the wanes of the ſea and to wey the heights of mountaines in a ballance,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mach.</hi> 2.9.</note> now being humbled to the ground was carried in a porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſeate teſtifying the manifeſt power of God in himſelfe: ſoe that out of the body of the impious man wormes crawled abundantly and his liue flesh fell
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:98706:265"/>of for paines, with his ſmell alſo and ſtinke the army was annoyed.</hi> Now what better was this man for all his worldly greatnes, when God would thus punish him? he was made an example to others of the power of God, and becauſe he made not good vſe of his afflictions, as Iob did; but remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill in his wickednes, he was neuer reſtored to proſperity againe, but died miſerably. It is therefor a vaine thinge to forſake God for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall proſperity, ſeeing that all bleſſings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from him, and cannot be had but by him. And yet that which is moſt abſurde of all, theſe very men, that goe to the deuill for riches, and for a pleaſant life, come to God to aske bread of him in their prayers. They ſerue the world and the deuill and aske their liuelyhood of God. Is not this abſurde? Seruants aske their wages of the maſters whom they ſerue; as ſouldiers doe of their captaines and generals. Was their euer any ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that went to the general of the enemys campe to aske pay or prouiſion? If then worldlings you will ſerue the world, why doe you aske your bread of God? or if you thinke that he onely can proſper you, and reward you euen with temporal bleſſings, why doe you ſerue any other but him for them? Serue God and be conſtant to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice according to the rules of the Catholike Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Chriſt was a moſt perfect maſter of all vertues and nothing was there neceſſary or good for vs to
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:98706:266"/>learne, but he hath taught it moſt perfectly, both by word and by worke; yet of all the leſſons which he hath giuen, there is nothing ſo much incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by him, as charity and meekenes to others. Firſt in his owne perſon he hath giuen vs ſuch an example, that we cannot comprehende the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it, The very Sonne of God to ſuffer words and blowes, and in the end death it ſelfe by his wicked and curſed ſeruants, that he might chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge their curſe into bleſſings; what shall we ſay or thinke of this? He could with one twinkle of his eye haue deſtroyed his enemys, and freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but he would let them goe on in perſecuting of him vnto death, and then pray for them. He was ſcoffed at and held his peace, he was accuſed and anſwered not for himſelfe, he was ſtrucken and bore it patiently, hee was crucifyed and prayed for thoſe that crucifyed him, his whole life and death was a continuall patterne of this vertue; and for his words, his paraboles and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they were allways commending it, tending continually to the loue of God by the loue of our neighbour. And S.

But mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne haeretiks haue a ready anſwere to this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they make God the cauſe and authour of ourſinne, and take away freewill from vs, that we are led by force into ſinne.

But the Catholike Church hath neuer conſented to any ſuch doctrine; but hath allways taught that the good which we doe is of God, and that the euill which we doe is of ourſelues; as shall be declared more opportunly in the twelfth diſcourſe of ſinne, I will now onely shew in what ſenſe wee pray not to bee led into temptation.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of temptations, that is to ſay tryals (for to tempt is the ſame as to try. Firſt when of ignorance one will take a tryall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth not vntill be try: and thus God neuer needeth to tempt or try any; becauſe hee knoweth before hand both what we can doe, and what we will doe The ſecond kind of temptation or tryall is by exerciſing and teaching? as when ſouldiers are tryed, that is trained and exerciſed to batle: or as theeues that try and traine vp o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to theeuery: and this kind of practicall temptation is good or euill, as it hath relation,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:98706:272"/>and is intended for a good or euill action A Captaine teacheth his ſouldier how to defende himſelfe, and to offende his enemy in a iuſt warre, a theefe or robber teacheth his partner how to defende himſelfe, and offende another in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt action. A Maſter of fence teacheth his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the poſtures, and guards of his owne defence, and ſometimes he hitteth him a blow to make him remember and learne the better: an enemy cometh with his weapon againſt him, not to teach him, but to take his life. God allways tempteth vnto goodnes, as a good Captaine, as a louing maſter to teach and enable vs. Thus he tempted the Iſraelites that by their victorys others might learne to ouercome.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Your God tempteth you, that it may appeare whether you loue him or not.</hi> So he tempted Abraham to immolate his ſonne? Firſt intending his good, then giuing him efficacious grace to obey, and laſtly rewarding him. This is a moſt bleſſed kind of temptation: he ſendeth vs againſt our enemy; but hee putteth the victory into our hands, giuing vs grace to ouercome if we will, and then crowneth vs for ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. As a maſter hee ſtriketh vs ſometimes by afflictions, and euen by thoſe blows he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs and ſtrengtheneth vs to ouercome, and then rewardeth vs. This is not to tempt vs to ſinne; but to traine vs vp to victorys and crowns. Well might S.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ia.</hi> 5.</note> Iames ſay, <hi>Let noe man when he is tempted ſay that hee is tempted of God. For God is not a tempter of euills.</hi> Thoſe whom God tempteth he tempteth for their greater glory, hee tryeth them, and as gold in the furnace he proueth them. The
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:98706:272"/>deuill tempteth allwais as a theefe intending euill, and as an enemy to hurt, and to kill our ſoules. God permitteth him to tempt; but hee giueth allways ſufficient grace for vs to ouercome if we will vſe it: and if we will not vſe it, it is not his falt, nor can our ſinne be imputed to him, who giueth grace to hinder it; but onely it may be ſaid to be permitted of God. And ſo Exod 7. God is ſaid to have hardened Pharao his hart; that is permitted him to harden his owne hart, as is declared in the eight chapter, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where not God, but Pharao himſelfe is ſaid to haue hardened his hart. And to thinke as Caluin doth that God created any of purpoſe that they might ſinne, is a thought vnworthy of a Chriſtian, or of any man that beleeueth God to be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme good.</p>
               <p>That therefore which we aske in this petition is that God will not permitte vs to be tempted ſo, as to yeeld to temptation; but that he will giue vs efficacious grace to reſiſt, and ouercome all temptations. We aske not that we may neuer be tempted, for ſo we should neuer be crowned; the crown of victory not being obtained but by batle. We pray for victory and this by the helpe of God is eaſily obtained.

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:98706:273"/>the deuill, and as gloriouſly rewarded of God that gaue it. Let vs pray to God and ſerue him, and he will giue grace againſt temptations. For this is the way: to arme ourſelues with prayer, and vigilancy againſt them, and to keepeallwais in our harts a vehement deteſtation of all mortall ſinne in general; and when any particular temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation beginneth in vs, to reſiſt it preſently at firſt, by making a contrary act to it, and then without delay to fly the occaſion of that kind of ſinne.

               <p>I ſaid at firſt that the <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect patterne, and forme of prayer, which our bleſſed Sauiour made for our inſtruction. Let vs then obſerue dilligently the methode of it,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:98706:273"/>Firſt we are taught in it, to deſire aboue all things the honour of God, and to direct all our prayers to that end, that the name of God which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly holy in it ſelfe, may be hallowed alſo exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by vs. And hauing asked that the name of God be hallowed, and alſo all things that are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiuely good for vs; then we aske to be freed from that which is hurtfull and eſpecially to be freed from ſinne, as the moſt hurtfull of all things; and for the future that we fall not againe by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; and laſtly to be freed from all euills in general, and in particular, which God knoweth to be euill for vs, and to be pardoned of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for our ſinnes. And it is to be obſerued that Chriſt would not onely teach vs to pray for ourſelues, but for all others; that ſoe we might keepe ourſelues in charity with all. We ſay not <hi>my father, giue mee, forgiue mee, lead mee not</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>our father, giue vs, forgiue vs, lead vs not</hi> &amp;c. And we are taught alſo to forgiue our enemys, and to pray for them. In fine the art and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of this prayer is more then man can expreſſe or vnderſtande; much leſſe can it be perfectly imitated by any prayer which we can make, nor that the Angels can deuiſe. Yet it was not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Chriſt to binde vs to ſay noe other prayer but it; for both he and the Apoſtles, are read to haue ſaid other prayers: neither that we should allwais pray for all that is conteined in it; but that we should allwais pray for all, or for ſomethinge that is in it, or conformable to it; and with that order that the honour of God be firſt ſought for in all our prayers, and that all

               <p>When therefor we pray for any temporal thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, we ought firſt to deſire the honour of God, and our owne ſpirituall good by it, before that we aske for the thinge it ſelfe; and we are to reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne our wills to the will of God: and firſt ſeeke to be freed from our ſinnes before that we pray to be freed from any other euill; and not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when any thinge troubleth vs to pray onely for our owne eaſe and content: as ſome doe who if their head, or their breaſt or backe ake, or are in any affliction, or danger, they complaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently where it paineth them, and without any more adoe, pray to be freed from it: but this is not according to our patterne of prayer, in which we are taught firſt to pray for the honour of God, and our owne ſpiritual good, ſaying at leaſt in our hatts <hi>hallowed be thy name, thy kingdome come</hi> &amp;c, in the firſt place of our prayer: and allwais to be pleaſed with that which pleaſeth God, not too earneſtly deſiring to be freed from temporal euills; aſſuring ourſelues that if we haue not our prayer, we haue that which is better for vs; ſuch afflictions being many times ſent of God, as a ſpeciall meanes of our ſaluation.

And for this reaſon, S. Hierome might well ſay that <hi>Amen</hi> is the ſeale of our Lords prayer to declare that God doth as it were ſet his hand to it.</p>

               <p>THE infinite wiſdome, and goodnes of God, hauing from all eternity decreed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankind by the death of his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; that hee should aſſume humane nature, and be borne of a Virgin to dy for vs: and the bleſſed Virgin Mary being choſen amongſt thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and amongſt thouſands of thouſands, and infinit of infinites, which God could haue created to be the woman of which he would bee borne: and she being now growne vp to womans ſtate, and perfected with ſuch graces, as were neceſſary for that dignity, the plenitude of time was then come in which this myſtery was to bee accomplished. And as all the works of God are with order and holines, ſo that this worke might be more orderly and holy, a meſſenger was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from Heauen vnto her, to require her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that this myſtery ſo much for the honour of God, and good of mankind might be brought to paſſe in her; and words were inſpired him how to ſpeake her.

But it is not ſo much in the ſenſe of that place to bee full of the holy Ghoſt, as it is to he full of grace. For there the gifts only of the holy Ghoſt are vnderſtoode, to wit of ſpeaking in ſtrange tongues, of prophecy, of caſting forth deuils, curing diſeaſes, and working other the like miracles, which gifts were giuen to them: and which may, and are ſometimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe who are farre from being full of grace, nay ſometimes euen to graceles men who are out of the ſtate of grace: as the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was giuen to Caiphas the enemy of Chriſt, then ſitting in iudgement againſt him, and to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam an idolatour;

Saint Steuan is ſaid to haue bene full of grace. <hi>Steuan full of grace and fortitude did great wonders and ſignes amongſt the people.</hi> But Saint Steuans grace was, as you ſee, in the ſame ſenſe, and manner, as we haue ſaid of the Apoſtles, for the working of wonders and ſignes, But our bleſſed Lady was full of a higher grace, to wit of ſanctifying grace, by which she was gracious in the ſight of God; as the Angell preſently interpreted his owne words, when ſeeing her to bee troubled at his ſpeech, he comforted her declaring what kind of grace hers was: to wit grace with God; ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt found grace with God.</hi> Which is farre more then the grace of miracles; and was the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that he could poſſible giue her.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 6.</note> For declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her grace was with God, she was giuen to vnderſtande that she was then in ſtate of diuine grace and fauour; which is the greateſt comfort that a ſoule can deſire; and to be aſſured of it by an Angell from Heauen, was a moſt ſingular and high priuiledge, and without doubt aboue all meaſure of content to her. So that the grace of which the Angell ſpoke to our bleſſed Lady was ſanctifying grace, and she was ſaluted full of it. And if wee should vnderſtande the fulneſſe of ſaint Steuans grace to haue bene ſpoken of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying grace, as our bleſſed Ladys was, and as his was not; yet it had bene a greater honour
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:98706:278"/>and priuiledge to her, then it had bene to him; for that it was ſaid of him onely after, his death; but it was neuer reuealed vnto him in his life time, that we know of, that he was full of grace; much leſſe was he euer ſoe ſaluted by an Angell. This was then ſuch a ſalutation as before was neuer heard. And it was good reaſon that it should be ſoe in this embaſſage, which was the moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that euer was in the world, both in reſpect of the buſines, which it concerned, of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſonne of God, then preſently to be fullfilled; and alſo in reſpect of our Bleſſed Lady, who was the moſt honorable perſonage that euer was created, and who of all pure creatures was to haue the greateſt honour, and neereſt relation to this myſtery; as the natural mother of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Which dignity was ſoe high and eminent in her, that (as I shall shew afterwards, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the graces with which her ſoule was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed) it was without compariſon greater then any pure creature was euer aduanced vnto; and ſoe great that there was noe grace euer giuen vnto any, but it was due to her for this dignity, as she was the mother of God. And therefor this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage required a more honorable ſalutation, and higher title to be giuen to her.</p>
               <p>This was in ſubſtance the ſame embaſſage that was deliuered many hundreds of veares before to the holy Patriarks; and which filled the hart of Abraham ſoe full of content, that he laughed for ioy to heare of it: for as it was reuealed to our B. Lady that Chriſt should be borne of her, ſoe was it vnto them that he should be borne of them,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:98706:279"/>and it was alſo reuealed by Angels to them. But there is a great difference in the circumſtances and manner of Chriſt his comming of them, and of her. He came not immediatly of their ſeede; but onely, as our bleſſed Lady came of their ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and he from her; and therefor the Angell vſed noe ſuch reſpect vnto them, as he did vnto her. When he ſpoke vnto Abraham he ſaid nothing of the grace which he had, he did not commende him as fullfilling of Gods Commandements; but rather exhorted him to fullfill them, and ſpoke as it were by authority to him, as his ſuperiour, ſaying in the perſon of God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty walke before mee and be perfect.</hi> But he came with much reuerence and ſubmiſſion to our B. Lady, not exhorting her to perfection; but rather commending her as perfect, when he ſaluted her <hi>full of grace:</hi> that is to ſay eminent in ſanctity and perſected with grace to that dignity, to which God had deſigned her. Yet if it were ſuch ioyfull newſe to Abraham, that Chriſt should come of his ſeede, and if it were made knowne by Angels to him, and to other Patriarks as a ſingular priuilege and honour, which God would doe to them, although after many ages and deſcents; how much more honourable was it to our bleſſed Lady to whom the immediate Conception of Chriſt was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as now preſently to be brought to paſſe in her? their embaſſages were but preparations to this, and but inferiour and partiall honours in them, to be completed and perfected in her. It was then noe meruaile if this myſtery were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with much ſubmiſſion by the Angell to
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:98706:279"/>her, who had the ſumme of the Patriarks praiſes and their perfections gathered together in her. She might with good reaſon be ſaluted full of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, who was prepared with ſanctity, for the cheife grace and higheſt fauour that euer God would doe to the world to be done immediatly by her, as the ſpeciall meanes and neereſt inſtrument of it.</p>
               <p>To vnderſtande how our B. Lady was full of grace we may deſtinguish three kindes, or as it were meaſures of fullnes of grace; euery one full in their meaſure. The firſt and cheife fullnes of grace is that which Chriſt had. Secondly that which our B. Lady had. Thirdly that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints. Chriſt was after a more high and eminent manner full of grace aboue all, in that he was the authour of all grace;

                  <hi>The glory of him</hi> (ſaith S. Iohn) <hi>glory as it were of the father full of grace and verity.</hi> And in reſpect of the vnion which his ſoule had with the diuine <hi>Word,</hi> it may be ſaid to be infinite in grace. The fullnes of his grace was alſo eminent aboue all, in that grace was giuen to him, as to the head, ſource, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which was to ſerue vs all with grace: <hi>of his fullnes</hi> (ſaith S. Iohn) <hi>all we haue receiued,</hi> noe grace being euer giuen to any, but as flowing from the merits of his paſſion. Next vnto Chriſt the B. Virgin had the greateſt fullnes of grace. For grace is giuen vnto creatures with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in order to the offices, and dignitys to which God deſigneth them; and ſoe the B. Virgin had a greater proportion of grace then any Angell or Saint had, for that she was deſigned
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:98706:280"/>to a higher office and dignity, then any Angell or Saint was. Her grace was to be ſuch as might render her worthy to be the woman, whom God would chooſe aboue all women to take flesh of, to nourish him in her wombe, to bring him forth to the world, to haue the charge of his infancy and education, and to haue him ſubiect vnto her (as the Euangeliſt declareth him to haue bene.) For all which a great meaſure and proportion of grace was neceſſary; that as her charge and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was eminent aboue all; ſoe might her grace be ſuetable vnto it. In the third place is the fullnes of grace which the Angels and Saints had to the fullfilling of thoſe works, to which God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them. And ſoe S. Steuan had fullnes of grace in order to the well performing of a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons office, to confounde the Iewes, and to be the firſt martyr, and encourager of others to ſuffer martyrdome for Chriſt by his example, and ſoe to enter into glory. Soe that Chriſt according to his humanity was moſt eminent in grace, <hi>goodly of beauty aboue the ſonnes of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 44.</note> in that his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was vnited to the diuine <hi>word,</hi> and was the fountaine of grace to vs. Our Bleſſed Lady was next to him, in that she had the higheſt office and greateſt charge, in relation to the myſtery of the Incarnation. The Angells and Saints were in a lower degree then she; yet they alſo had fullnes of grace in their meaſures, and in proportion to their offices They all haue fullnes of grace; but in ſeuerall kindes and in a different nature. The Angels and Saints in the loweſt place, our B. Lady aboue them, and Chriſt in a higher nature tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:98706:280"/>both them and her. And our B. Lady had not onely a higher nature of grace then the Angels and Saints had; but she had alſo a greater capacity in her ſoule, which God created as a more ample and capable veſſell conteining a greater meaſure of grace then they could conteine, although full alſo in their meaſure and capacity: and therefore she is compared to that huge veſſell called the Sea,

               <p>Firſt in the firſt age Saint Iames the Apoſtle in in his Lyturgy which he made for the Church ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, would not omitt to make a commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her.

Paul, in his booke de <hi>diuinis nominibus cap</hi> 33. relateth how that himſelfe after his conuerſion went to ſee her, for that she was left to be the comfort, and ioy of Chriſtians after the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt: and in his Epiſtle to Timothe hee deſcribeth the manner of her departure out of this life; how that all the Apoſtles, except S Thomas, being brought together miraculouſly from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall parts of the world to be preſent at her death, with deuout Canticles they celebrated her funerals for three dayes, the Angels ioyning
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:98706:281"/>their heauenly melody with them: and that Saint Thomas comming the third day, and deſiring to ſee her ſacred corps, her tombe was opened, that he might ſee her at leaſt after her death, but he ſaw her not, for that she was not there to be ſeene. A great ſweetnes iſſued out of the Sepulcher, and the linnens in which she was wrapped were left in it; but her ſacred body was not there. Thus Saint Denis and he concludeth this narration ſaying, That it could not bee thought, but that as God would preſerue her Virginal body free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Conception of her Sonne; ſoe he would preſerue it from corruption after her death, and Aſſume it to the glory of Heauen before the generall glorification of other bodys at the day of iudgment.

               <p>In the ſixt age liued Andreas Hieroſolymitanus Bishop of Crete, who calleth our bleſſed Lady, <hi>a ſaint holier then the Saints, the moſt holy treaſure of all ſanctity.</hi> Euſebius Emiſſenus liued in the ſame age, who ſpeaking of our B Lady, was ſtrucken with aſtonishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he knew not what to thinke of the greatnes of her graces. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if she were full of grace before she conceiued, what shall we thinke her to haue bene after it.</hi> But what what then shall we thinke her to haue bene after ſo many yeares of continuall, and ſuch intimate conuerſation with Chriſt? she being his mother and he her maſter.</p>

I might produce the Sentences of holy men in following ages vnto our dayes, to shew the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruance of that firſt and auncient denotion to her, to haue bene at all times in the Catholik Church. I might alleadge the words of S. Anſelme,

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:98706:284"/>were moſt ſingularly deuoted to his bleſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, many wayes. Some of them inſtituted par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deuotions to her, and inuiting all to thoſe deuotions haue ſpared noe labour to increaſe her honour, and the number of her ſeruants. But this needes not; for that I haue shewed it to haue bene the deuotion of the Catholike Church in thoſe times, in which her enemys confeſſe, and muſt needes confeſſe the true faith of Chriſt to haue flourished, if euer it flourished. That which the Catholike Church ſtill laboureth for, is to preſerue in her people the ſame deuotion which was then giuen to her. And therefor she conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crateth Churches, erecteth altares, inſtituteth holy dayes, and omitteth nothing to ſetforth her worthy prayſes, and the power of her interceſſion, which afterwards I shall shew.</p>
               <p>The English Proteſtant Church is not yet ſoe auncient, but that I haue knowne diuerſe who haue remembred the like deuotion to haue bene in this kingdome to her, when the Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion flourished in it. English men were then bleſſedly and ſingularly aboue other nations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to her, reioycing in her patronage, and ioyfull ſolemnitys. But now that ioy is turned into hatred and contempt, and her cheife ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitys are blotted out and prophaned by them; and yet abſurdly, and without conſequence they will ſeeme to honour the Saints, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their holydayes to be kept. Is it not an abſurde and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious proceeding in them to her, to commande the holydayes of the Saints, and Angels, as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fitting, and to take away the cheife holy
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:98706:284"/>dayes of our B. Lady? yet this the English pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church hath done; as may be ſeene in their commune prayer booke, where the Feaſts of the Apoſtles, and of other Saints, and of the Angels, are commanded by their Church, and not the Natiuity and Aſſumption of our B. Lady, which were allwais held her cheife ſolemnitys. As for her Annunciation and Purification, they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them in honour of the Conception and Preſentation of Chriſt, and cunningly ſeeme as though they would honour her; but this cunning is worth nothing to thoſe that vnderſtande her Natiuity and Aſſumption to be her cheife and moſt propper feaſts, and ſoe auncient that S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome and S. Auguſtine haue left ſermons which they made of them; and which they taking away, keepe noe day at all as propper to her. It is the nature of malice to hate all that which is worthy of loue; and of enuious perſons to hate that which their enemys loue, though neuer ſoe good. This is the very true cauſe why the beginners of this English religion would take away her two cheife holydayes.

What iniury had the moſt bleſſed of women, and their particular patroneſſe done to them? in what had she deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this at their hands? but that they would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Catholike Church.

S. Ambroſe confirmeth it when he calleth her the <hi>ſtandart bearer of virginity,</hi>

                     <hi>Amb. to.</hi> 2. <hi>de inſt. Virg. c.</hi> 5. <hi>Bed. in Luc.</hi> 1.</note> as going before all in the perpetuall vow of it. But S. Bede ſaith more planely that she was <hi>the firſt that emancipated herſelfe</hi> to that vertue, which muſt be vnderſtoode by perpetual vow; for there were diuerſe before her, that vowed it for a time. Soe that we may number this amongſt our B. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys prayſes that she was the firſt foundres of the perpetual vow of Virginity, and ſoe she is the particular patroneſſe of Prieſts, and religious perſons that follow her in that vow. She had more ouer a gift of God to make thoſe to be Virgins that conuerſed with her: and ſoe ſaith S. Hierome that she made S. Ioſeph to be a Virgin; and S. Ambroſ. that she made S. Iohn Baptiſt to be a virgin by her virginal conuerſation: that as
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:98706:286"/>it is written of the Cedar tree and of the flowers of vines,

                  <hi>I as a vine haue fructifyed ſweetneſſe of odour.</hi> Chriſt would bee botne of a Virgin for the honour of virginity, and to condemne Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian and other licentious haeretiks that were to condemne it. And therefore hee would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it himſelfe, and haue his mother to obſerue it by vow. Neither was her marriage oppoſite to this vow; for as it was reuealed vnto her that without detriment of her virginity she should conceiue, ſo without doubt her integrity in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage (which was leſſe) was alſo by diuine reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made knowne to her. Chriſt would alſo be borne of a married woman for the honour of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and to refute the Encratites, and ſuch like phantaſticall haeretiks, that were to condemne it; and alſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue her honour that she might not be ſuſpected tohaue conceiued vnlawfully, and as ſuch to be ſubiect to the penalty of the law. S. Ignat. Martyr and S. Iohn Damaſcen adde alſo a third reaſon: to wit to conceale the manner of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the deuill; that he might not ſtriue to hinder in any thing the more perfect working of that myſtery, which was fullfilled in her: and therefore they ſeeme to thinke that God would binde and limit his vnderſtanding ſo, that ſeeing
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:98706:286"/>her to be married, he should not attende to the manner of her conceiuing; but that she conceiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a married woman. In briefe the ſumme of her prayſes out of the Sentences of the Fathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged is, <hi>That she excelleth in dignity, ſanctity, and glory all men and Angells, euen the higheſt Seraphims; that she is the miracle of the world that she is our Lady, our Miſtres, our Queen, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, the Treaſure of Sanctity, that she was vndefiled, and vntouched with ſinne; that her life is the rule and diſcipline of ours; that she was a perpetuall Virgin and the crowne of virginity; that she is the Miſtres, and Scepter of the Catholike Faith; and that she is our Aduocate.</hi> Theſe are the praiſes which you haue ſeene giuen auncient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the holy Fathers to her, and which all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes will euer giue her. Well might the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſalute her full of grace, whom God had fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch graces. With what reuerence may we thinke he comported himſelfe to her? he named her not at firſt hy her proper name, as we doe when we ſay, Haile Mary full of grace, with more hopes and confidence to require her interceſſion, which the Angell required not; but afterwards ſeeing her troubled at his ſpeech, to comfort her, he preſently called her by her name, ſaying, <hi>Feare not Mary,</hi> it being then nececeſſary to condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende to a more familiar manner of ſpeaking then at firſt he would vſe of due ſubmiſſion vnto her? Out of all which we may gather what obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we haue to be deuoted to our bleſſed Lady, and how pleaſing that deuotion is to God.</p>

<note place="margin">Exorciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</note> which the poſſeſſed perſon hath no skill of, and is inwardly moued wish a pious motion of his hart to beleeue that which he ſeeth to be true, is ſurer of it then he is of any thinge which he ſeeth onely by the ſunshine, and hath noe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pious motion of minde to beleeue it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is recorded of the miracles of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto is neuer published, but vpon good authority, prudent grounds, and ſufficient witneſſes, warily and ſtrictly examined; and is done ſometimes in
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:98706:289"/>the ſight of multitudes to teſtify it; and ſo in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cannot be denyed And to queſtion or to deny all the miracles which are recorded of that place, is more abſurde then if one should queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deny all the whole records of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth or Kingdome, which are deliuered with much leſſe circumſpection then the hiſtorys of Laureto are.</p>
               <p>As for the time in which this viſion appeared, and in which the myſtery of the Incarnation was fullfilled, it was according to ſaint Luke, in the ſixt month after the Conception of S. Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt: which being on the 25. of Septemb, this muſt haue bene in March, and to complete ſix months it muſt haue bene on the 25. of March, as the Church celebrateth it. As for the day ſome haue contemplated that it was vpon a Fryday; that as Adam was created on a Friday and ſinned on a Friday, (for he is thought to haue bene but ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes in Paradiſe (ſo Chriſt, who was to be a ſecond Adam to the deſtruction of ſinne, and to the reparation of our nature, should be conceiued alſo on a Fryday. As for the hower, it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought, to haue bene about midnight, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of holy Wiſedome,

               <p>THESE words were ſpoken by S. Elizabeth to our B. Lady after her Conception of Chriſt. The bleſſed Virgin as she was full of grace, ſo alſo she was full of charity; and of charity was moued to vndertake a troubleſome iourney vnto the hilly contrey of Iury, with much feruour and ſpeede to ſee S.

Thus doth Saint Iohn Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome deſcribe this paſſage. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he <hi>(therefore made his mother to ſalute S.

               <p>This fruit was bleſſed in many reſpects. Firſt for that it was diuine, and had all the diuine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and yet was the fruit of her wombe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that Chriſt is the fountaine and oti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen of all our bleſſe by his merits. Thirdly, for that according to the ſame humane nature, he was in himſelfe more eminently bleſſed then any. Fourthly, for that this fruite came of a better ſtocke then any: to wit of the holy Ghoſt, and of the bleſſed Virgin. Fiftly, for that this fruit was the onely antidote againſt the forbidden fruit. In all theſe reſpects it was moſt bleſſed. And if you would know what fruit is here vnderſtoode, it is IESVS. Bleſſed then is the fruite of thy wombe, IESVS.

And although Chriſt (to exhort vnto holines of life, and to shew that it is the inward ſanctity of our ſoules, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth vs bleſſed in the ſight of God) anſwered that they are bleſſed who keepe the word of God: and therefor S. Auguſtine ſaith that the Virgin Mary was more bleſſed in that she conceiued Chriſt in her minde, then in that she conceiued him in her wombe, and in that she carried him in her hart ſpiritually, then in her flesh corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; becauſe she merited in that, and not in this; which we all ſay: but neither Chriſt, nor S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine deny, but that she is to be honored alſo for her corporal conceiuing of him; and Chriſt as you haue ſeene did honour her in that reſpect. She alſo honored herſelfe in it, and tooke it as a great bleſſing of God, to be choſen to that high maternity, and meant without doubt that all generations should call her bleſſed in this reſpect; for it is not likely that her intention was to extoll her owne vertues, as bleſſed onely for them; but for the great things which the mighty one had done to her; to wit for the dignity with which God had honored her, in chooſing her before all others to be incarnated of her nature, and to be borne of her; hauing diſpoſed and praepared her
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:98706:292"/>with fitt diſpoſitions for that dignity: and for this all generations of Catholiks will call her bleſſed, although Caluin will be none of that generation. The fathers of the auncient Church gaue her, as you haue ſeene, that honorable title of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God: and the whole Church in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Epheſus decreed to giue it her; therefor it is lawfull to honour her with it.</p>
               <p>I ſay yet more that we may not onely honour her in this corporal reſpect; but we may alſo with reaſon thinke, that there was noe grace, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſanctity euer giuen to any pure creature, but it was moſt decent that in this reſpect, as she was the Mother of God, she should be endowed with it.

It were a ſaying
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:98706:293"/>dishonorable to Chriſt to impute any heinous ſinne vnto his Mother, with whom S. Auguſtine will haue noe mention of ſinne to be made: and as it were a dishonour to him to make her that bore him, and had the education of him to be a ſinner; ſoe is it moſt for his honour to haue her a Saint, and aboue all Saints. We haue then out of the ſcriptures that Chriſt honored her, that she tooke it as an honour to herſelfe, and that S. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth and the woman of the ghoſpell honored her as she was the Mother of ſuch a ſonne: and we haue alſo that it was moſt decent and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her dignity, that her bleſſed ſoule should be adorned with the higheſt grace, and ſanctity, that euer any pure creature had.

               <p>When we ſay the Mother of God we meane that she was the true Mother of him, who was true God; which all good chriſtians beleeue and none but ſuch as Neſtorian haeretiks will deny: for as we ſay truely that S.

               <p>S. Iohn Damaſcene who relateth this might ſpeake by experience of our B. Ladys power. He was a man of eminent ſanctity and learning in his time, and a great defendour of our B. Ladys honour. Amongſt other works which he wrote, he ſetforth three books of holy images: by which the Iconoclaſt haeretiks, that went about deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of images, were ſoe incenſed againſt him, that (as the fashion of haeretiks is) they accuſed him to his Prince as a traitour, and diſturber of the publike peace. Who being a Saracene, and too credulous of their falſe accuſations, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his right hand to be cut of. But the ſentence being executed, it fell out better then the haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks expected. For the ſeruant of God being very much troubled to ſee the want of his hand, which he had vſed and thought ſtill to haue vſed in his ſeruice, with many teares beſought the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who is the comfort of the afflicted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, promiſing that if his hand were reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe, he would imploy it ſtill in defence of the diuine honour, as he had done before. In that trouble of minde he fell a ſleepe, and in his ſleepe he ſaw the image of our B. Lady before which he prayed with a gracious and comfortable aſpect beholding him, and heard it ſay. <hi>See now your hand is ſounde againe; he carefull to imploy it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your promiſe.</hi> And awaking out of his ſleepe he founde it reſtored ſounde and perfect. Caniſius l. 9. c. 19.</p>

               <p>In the reigne of the Emperour Iuſtinian a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſteward of a Church in Cilicia, and as ſome ſay an Archdeacon by name Theophilus, who had liued in great eſteeme, and had refuſed the dignity of bishop, was depriued of his office by ſome that aemulated him. Which diſgrace (as he accounted it) was ſoe greeuous to him, that by pride and melancholy he became deſperate to the vtter contempt of ſaluation, and by a Iewish ſorcerer was perſwaded to put his ſoule into the deuills power, giuing him for ſecurity a bond of his owne hand writing with it. But afterwards being ſtrucken with remorſe, he beganne to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of the miſerable ſtate in which his ſoule was, and how to diſenſlaue it out of the deuils bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. He happily had recourſe vnto our B. Lady, and going into a Church conſecrated to her, he remained there day and night, cleauing as it were to the ground in prayer and pennance to implore helpe of her. In the end his feruerous prayer was heard, and his petition granted: in proofe of which the bond of his hand writing in the preſence of many by the power of God was reſtored vnto him, and put into his hands againe. Where vpon afterwards he became a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, and a canonized Saint. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Caniſius l. 5. c. 20. and prooued by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient teſtimony of authors, and eſpecially by Eutichianus Patriarke of Conſtantinople, who ſaith, that he was borne in the houſe of the ſaid Theophilus, and was an eye witnes of this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. But I will ſpeake that which I know my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>A Catholike woman in the Bishoppricke of
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:98706:296"/>Durham, being apprehended for her religion, and committed to Durham gaole, was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goe home againſt the time of her child bearing. When her time came she had a long and very ſore labour, and was brought to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that her neighbors who were about her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented hopeleſſe of her life. But she called ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly vpon our B.

After her departure the ſicke woeman beganne to haue a better labour, and was ſafely deliuered of a ſonne: who arriuing vnto mans eſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a lay brother of a religious order, in which for any thinge I know he is ſtill liuing. The woman recouered very well, and in her old age related the whole paſſage vnto mee. Which although I had heard of by a freind before; yet I was very glad to haue it from her ſelfe, who to my thinking was one of the moſt matronlike and ſaintlike women that euer I ſaw.</p>
               <p>The power of our B. Lady hath appeared noe leſſe in terrour of her enemys, then in fauour of her freinds.

            </p>
            <p>The deuotion of the Roſary or Beades con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſteth moſt of the Haile Mary, a prayer which we ought to eſteeme of for many reaſons. Wee may ſay that next vnto the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> it is the beſt of all prayers. Firſt, for the dignity of thoſe that made it. Chriſt made the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> and the Angell Gabriel, Saint Elizabeth and the Church made the Haile Mary, and all other prayers are made, or allowed of onely by the Church: ſo that the Haile Mary is in the midle
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:98706:300"/>place, below the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> and aboue all other prayers. Secondly, it is very much to be eſteemed of for our bleſſed Ladys ſake, who is the moſt worthy and noble perſonage of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and as the <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> is the cheife and proper prayer of all which we ſay immediatly to God: ſo the Haile Mary is the cheife and moſt proper prayer of our bleſſed Lady. Thirdly, it is moſt eminently to be eſteemed of for the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which is chiefly concerned in it: to wit the myſtery of the Incarnation, which is the chiefe myſtery of the Chriſtian faith: and this we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in the words of the Angell comming from Heauen with the newſe of it to declare to the bleſſed Virgin that then preſently it was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in her, and ſaluting her, ſaying, <hi>Haile full of grace, our Lord is wrth thee, bleſſed art thou among woman, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe words in our Beades, wee often repeate, and wee haue good reaſon often to repeate them, to remember that myſtery, to celebrate that bleſſed hower of the Sonne of God his Incarnation. Saint Athanaſius called them words of praiſe to our bleſſed Lady. and ſaith that the quires of Heauen are inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinging that, which he calleth, <hi>a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ample Hymne;</hi>

               </note> Wee curſe not them, but pray for their conuerſion; but if wee curſe them not we ought at leaſt to bleſſe God for our ſelues, and often to remember our owne hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, thankfully acknowledging the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:98706:300"/>of the Chryſtian faith. A Iew would by glad to ſee the memory of Chriſt rooted out of the world; but this he shall neuer ſee. Good Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians will allwais reuerence him, keeping thoſe ſolemnitys, and practiſing thoſe ceremonys, and prayers that put vs in minde of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore we often ſay the Haile Mary in remembrance of the benefits which we haue by him, and to honour her that bore him, and to craue her prayers.</p>
            <p>Saint Dominike was the firſt that deuiſed the Roſary as it is now vſed. A man of that ſanctity of life; that Proteſtants themſelues acknowledge him for a holy Saint. He was a Prieſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church: and as ſuch he thought himſelfe indebted both <hi>to the wiſe and unwiſe.</hi> To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this debt he deuiſed the deuotion of the Roſary; which although it were chiefly intended for the good of the ignorant that can not reade: yet it may be vſed alſo by the learned, as now we ſee it is by the greateſt Doctors of the Catholike Church of deuotion to our bleſſed Lady. Thoſe that can read haue their bookes to pray in; and thoſe that cannot reade, haue their Beades as books to imploy themſelues in, in which they may read the cheife myſterys of the life, and death of Chriſt, and our B. Lady.</p>
            <p>The Roſary was made by S. Dominike as a holy Pſalter, in imitation of that which King Dauid made. For as it was the deuotion of that holy King to compoſe a Pſater of deuout Pſalmes, and thoſe in number a hundred and fifty; (if they were all of King Dauids compoſing) ſo it was the
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:98706:301"/>deuotion of S. Dominike to deuiſe a Pſalter of a hundred and fifty Pſalmes in imitation of that. And that this Pſalter might be more practiſed by all, he made it not of new and different Pſalmes which few would haue gotten without booke; but of ſo many Haile Marys which all either haue, or should haue without booke; and which are to be repeated after ſuch a manner, as might eaſily be learned of all. And as the muſicall inſtrument which Dauid vſed in the ſinging of his Pſalmes, was an inſtrument of ten ſtrings, in relation to the ten Commandements; ſo would Saint Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minike diuide his Pſalter of Aue Marys into tennes deſtinguished by a <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> to be ſaid in the beginning of eyery ten: ſo that there being in all fifteene tenns, fifteene cheife myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys of the life and death of Chriſt, and of our B. Lady might be celebrated.</p>
            <p>The fifteene myſterys correſponding to the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene tenns of the Roſary are diſtinguished into fiue ioyfull, fiue ſorrowfull, and fiue glorious. Tho ſiue ioyfull are, The Annunciation, The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, The Natiuity, The Purification of our B.

The firſt ten is ſaid in honour of the Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was when the Angell Gabriell deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to our bleſſed Lady that ioyfull meſſage, announcing vnto her that she should conceiue in her wombe <hi>the Sonne of the moſt High</hi> The ſecond ten is ſaid in honour of the Viſitation; which was when the bleſſed Virgin hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode by the Angell that her coſen Saint Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:98706:301"/>had conceiued a ſonne in her old age, to wit Saint Iohn Baptiſt, she made a viſit vnto her, to comfort her, helpe her, and to be as a handmaid, to ſerue her the ſeruant of God. And arriuing at her houſe and ſaluting her, Saint Iohn Baptiſt leaped in his mothers wombe, Saint Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth prophecyed, and our bleſſed Lady pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a Canticle of ioy: in remembrance of which we offer vp the ſecond ten. The third ten is ſaid in honour of the Natiuity of Chriſt which was a myſtery full of ioy; firſt vnto our bleſſed Lady, as more neerely concerning her in the firſt ſight of her ſonne: and alſo to all men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Angels ſpeech.

The ſecond is his whipping at the pillar. The third is his crowning with thornes. The fourth is the carrying of his Croſſe, when after that they had weakened him with many torments, they led him or rather trailed him about the ſtreets of Hieruſalem with his heauy Croſſe on his shoulders vntil he was ſoe ſpout; that they who of pitty would not eaſe him of it, in the end of cruelty tooke it from him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life vntill they had crucifyed him.

The ſecond is his Aſcenſion, at which the Apoſtles were rauished to behold his glory.

The fourth is the glorious Aſſumption of our B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Lady: whoſe ſoule departing from her body in death, was preſently glorifyed, and the third day according to auncient Authors returning to her body to glorify it, they were both together aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpted into Heauen: for if it bee probably thought of thoſe bodys which aroſe from the dead in the Reſurrection of Chriſt, that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended with him glorious into Heauen; we can not thinke with reaſon that the ſacred body of which our Lord tooke flesh should corrupt in the earth, and remaine ſoe vntill the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnglorifyed. The ſift is her glorious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation in the Celeſtiall Court, And although
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:98706:303"/>theſe two laſt myſterys, of the Aſſumption and of the Coronation of our bleſſed Lady, may ſeeme to ſome to be the ſame; yet there is a great difference betwixt them; her Aſſumption intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely, her ſtate of glory in generall, to wit that she was aſſumed body and ſoule into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and her Coronation importing her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate of glory, as she is crowned the Queene of Heauen aboue all Angels and Saints. Theſe are in breife the fifteene myſterys of the Roſary. The ſiue ioyfull are the Annunciation, The Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, The Natiuity, The Purification of our Lady and the Preſentation of Chriſt, The Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him diſputing in the Temple. The ſiue ſorrowfull are, The Praying in the Garden, The Whipping at the pillar, The Crowning with thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, The carrying of the Croſſe, The Crucifying and death of Chriſt. The fiue glorious are his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, his Aſcenſion, The Comming of the holy Ghoſt, The Aſſumption, and Coronation of our bleſſed Lady. When we haue not time or leaſure to ſay all the fifteene tenns in honour of the fifteene myſterys, wee may ſay ſiue in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of any fiue of them; either of the fiue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or of the fiue dolotous, or of the fiue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as we will, allwais concluding with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creede in profeſſion of our faith.</p>
            <p>It is true all doe not vnderſtande that theſe myſterys are thus conteined in the Roſary, nor allways remember them when they ſay their Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; but the Church of God vnderſtoode and remembred them in the approouing and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that deuotion. It is not neceſſary that euery

It were indeed very good that all vnderſtoode the myſterys of the Roſary: and therefore we expounde them. And it were very good that all remembred them when they ſay their Beades: and therefore before euery ten I vſe to mention in particular the myſtery of that ten: as for example before the firſt <hi>Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The intention therefore of the Catholike Church by the Roſary is to keepe the ignorant, eſpecially thoſe that can not reade imployed in this deuout exerciſe, and to propoſe vnto all the remembrance and conſideration of holy things. From whence proceedeth that coldneſſe, looſnes,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:98706:304"/>and auerſion from good works, and holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes which is in many, but from the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of pious things?

            <p>But becauſe we haue made mention of the <hi>Aut Mary</hi> bell,
<note place="margin">Of the Aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bell.</note> we will make a litle digreſſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in a word or two the meaning of it. The <hi>Aue Mary</hi> bell ringeth thrice euery day, to put vs in minde of three holy myſterys. In the morning in honour of Chriſts Reſurrection, which was in the morning time: at noone in honour of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and death, which was about noone time; at night in honour of the Incarnation which is thought to haue bene fullfilled about midnight,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:98706:304"/>At the ringing of this bell all Catholikes where ſoeuer they be, in their houſes, in the ſtreets, or fieldes, ſay the Angelical Salutation, as they know, and the prayer after it, in honour of thoſe myſterys. In which the Catholike Church sheweth the care which she hath ouer her people, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting this short but moſt profitable deuotion, to call them thrice on the day to the ſeruice of God, and to keepe their harts from time to time in a continuall tendernes towards him. Thus much for the <hi>Aue Mary</hi> bell.</p>
            <p>There are dinerſe other wayes of ſaying the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary beſide that which I haue declared. Sometimes we ſay ſixty tenns and three haile Marys; that is ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three haile Marys in honour of the ſixty three yeares of our B. Ladys life. S.

                  <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>virg.</hi>
               </note> Ambroſe faith that her life is a patterne of all vertues: which if it be, it is good to kepe it before our eyes at our prayers.</p>
            <p>This deuotion is called a Roſary, or the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. It is called a Roſary; becauſe thoſe prayers aſcende as a ſweet odour of roſes to God; as when S.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.</note> Iohn ſaw the prayers of the faithfull to aſcende as the odour of incenſe. We call it the Beades mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the inſtrument which we vſe when we ſay thoſe prayers: and improperly we terme it the ſaying of our beades, for the ſaying of our prayers on them, or by them to remember them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if the number of thoſe prayers be in it ſelfe lawfull, the inſtrument which we vſe but for memorys ſake can not with reaſon be diſallowed of. Sozomen relateth of S. Paul the Ermite that he vſed euery day to ſay three hundred prayers, and at the end of euery one to ſet downe a litle
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:98706:305"/>ſtone for his memory ſake. Soe we vſe beades, (which ſignify in English any litle peeces of ſtone, bone, wood, or other ſubſtance) to remember our prayers by them. And here it may be obſeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it is not likely that S. Paul ſaid euery day three hundred ſeueral prayers; but that he ſaid ſome one prayer ſoe many times ouer; for if they had bene different prayers they would haue deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished themſelues, and he should not haue needed ſtones to deſtinguish them. Nay if we conſider it rightly, we shall finde that the letting downe of a beade or ſtone at euery ſeuerall prayer would rather haue hindered, and confounded his memory; for ſoe he muſt both remember to ſet downe a ſtone to ſignify the number, and muſt haue allwais the ſame prayer correſponding to that number, and remember which prayer that was; and therefor he would not haue vſed ſtones but to remember how often he had ſaid the ſame prayer.
<note place="margin">Hier. ep. ad Fur.</note> S. Hierome aduiſeth his freind to ſelect a certaine number of verſes out of the ſcriptures, and to ſay them as a daily taske offered vp to God. Now if S. Hierome had aduiſed his freind to ſay thoſe verſes often ouer, and to vſe peeces of ſtone, bone, wood, or the like, as a memorial to remember them by, what hurt had he done? he had done that which the Catholike Church doth: that is he had aduiſed to a pious exerciſe, and to a good meanes to helpe their memory.</p>
            <p>But the enemys of the Catholike Church haue ſome thing to obiect againſt the Roſary, by which the ſolidity of it will appeare more. Firſt they ſay that the words of the Angell <hi>Haile full of grace</hi>
               <pb n="567" facs="tcp:98706:305"/>&amp;c. And the words of S. Elizabeth are not prayers; for they aske nothing; therefor they are not to be vſed as prayers. Here we haue that the words of the Roſary are Angelicall, taken our of the holy Scriptures, and we inferre therefor they are good to be vſed in our prayers. The lepar ſaid to Chriſt <hi>If thou wilt thou canſt make mc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.</note> In which words he formally and expreſly asked nothing. Yet they were well vſed of him to procure health of Chriſt. For although formally and expreſly ſuch words aske not, yet vertually and effectually they are prayers: that is they haue the vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of prayers with God, who granteth our deſires for the reuerence and humility which we shew by ſuch words: and ſoe the leprous man vertually and effectually asked by thoſe words, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deſire. Soe when Lazarus was ſicke his ſiſtars Martha and Mary ſent vnto Chriſt, ſaying, onely, <hi>Lord behold he whom thou loueſt is ſicke;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Io.</hi> 11.</note> in which words they did not formally and expreſly deſire Chriſt to come to heale him; but vertually they did, and by them they implyed as much as to ſay, we beſeech thee to heale him.

               <note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>it was enough to ſay he whom thou loueſt is ſicke; for of thoſe whom thou loueſt thou deſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>teſt none.</hi> They well knew that Chriſt was not a deſertour of his freinds and therefor they expreſly asked not, but onely told him the condition of his freind, and this had the effect of prayer with him. Soe the words of the haile Mary, as they are termes of reuerence and humility to our B. Lady, haue the effect of prayer, although expreſly they aske nothing.</p>
            <pb n="568" facs="tcp:98706:306"/>
            <p>Secondly they obiect: the words of the Haile Mary are the words of the Angell as by office; therefor he that vſeth them taketh vpon him the Angells office. It was indeede the Angells office in the ſonne of God his Incarnation to ſay the words of the Roſary, and to ſay <hi>Glory in the higheſt to God</hi> in his natiuity, and in both ſentences we reuerence thoſe myſterys and giue glory to God by rehearſing them. S. Athanaſius reioyceth that all the quires of the coeleſtial Hierarchys are iuceſſantly ſinging that <hi>glorious and ample hymne</hi> to wit <hi>Haile full of grace;</hi> and that we the terreſtrial hierarchy of men repeate it; although the Angel Gabriel was firſt appointed to ſay it. S. Athanaſius made a good argument; but it was quite contrary to this. This was his argument. The words of the Haile Mary are holy and myſterious words ſpoken by an Angell to honour the B. Virgin; therefor it is ſitting that all Angels, and men should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly vſe them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly they obiect that our B. Lady is farre diſtant from vs, and it is abſurde to ſalute one at ſuch a diſtance. But this is noe abſurdity; becauſe diſtance of place hindereth not the intelligence of glorious ſoules. It were indeede abſurde formen he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vpon earth to ſalute one another in abſence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in abſence they vnderſtande not; but if they vnderſtoode, it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ather abſurde to hinder their communication when it were for a good end. The bleſſed Virgin vnderſtandeth in heauen our deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon earth; for although in body she be abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from vs; yet in ſpirit sheis prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with vs: as Elizeus was abſent in body from his ſeruant; but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:98706:306"/>in ſpirit with him, and ſaw all that paſſed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt him and Naaman, and told him afterwards,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reg.</hi> 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>Was not my hart preſent, when the man returned out of his chaire to meete thee?</hi> S. Paul alſo wrote to the Corinthians, that he was abſent in body,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5.</note> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſpirit with them. But the bleſſed Virgin ſeeeth by the light of glory the deuotion of thoſe that pray to her, and is much more preſent with them then Elizeus or S. Paul were whilſt they liued vpon earth, abſent from them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly they obiect againſt the often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Haile Mary, that God heareth as well at once as at many times: but to repeate it a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty times, to what purpoſe? Yes for many good purpoſes Firſt to pray with more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, ſecondly to obtaine by perſeuering in prayer that, which at firſt is not allwais obtained; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imploy ourſelues in the conſideration of holy myſterys, ſuch as I haue declared to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the Roſary. Chriſt hauing deliuered to his diſciples the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> as a patterne of prayer, shewed them alſo how it was to be vſed: to wit with much earneſtnes and importunity; not preſently deſiſting from prayer when we obtaine not our deſire but perſeuering ſtill to aske. For this he immediatly annexed the parabole of a man, who asking to borrow bread, at firſt it was denyed him; but perſeuering to aske, by his importunity he obtained as many loaues, as he needed. And he did not onely teach this by word, but alſo by example, praying with much feruour, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the garden the ſame prayer, ouer,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</note> and ouer, and ouer againe: as S. Mathew hath noted.
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:98706:307"/>He was heard as well at the firſt as at the laſt; but he would teach vs to perſeuer in prayer, and that God granteth for our importunity: and therefor he had at laſt the comfort of an Angell appearing to him, which at firſt it is not likely that he had. The blinde man ſitting by the way, when he heard the noyſe of the multitude, and vnderſtoode that Ieſus of Nazareth was paſſing by, cryed out <hi>Ieſus ſonne of Dauid haue mercy vpon mee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 18.</note> And when they rebuked him he cryed much more <hi>Sonne of Dauid haue Mercy on mee.</hi> Chriſt heard him as well at the firſt as at the ſecond time; yet at firſt he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not his deſire; becauſe he would haue him to perſeuer asking, that he might commende his faith, grant for his perſeuerance, and propoſe him as an example to teach vs how to pray. The holy Kingin the 137. pſalme repeateth in euery verſe the very ſame words ouer againe; ſoe that there being 27. verſes the ſame thinge is repeated 27. times, and take vp about halfe of the pſalme An hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike might aske what neede there was of ſoe much repeating the ſame thinge? To whom I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, that Dauid was a holy man according to the hart of God, and would ſing the diuine praiſes with much feruour of ſpirit, repeating the ſame words ouer and ouer againe many times; and ſoe we repeate the praiſes of the B Virgin, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and redouble our prayers to her. Chriſt ſayeth it <hi>behoueth allwais to pray,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 8. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>and not to be weary.</hi> And S. Paul biddeth <hi>Pray without intermiſſion;</hi> but we can not allwais pray new prayers. If the prayer be a good prayer, the more we repeate it the more loue we shew, and more deſire of obtaining; and
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:98706:307"/>that which is to the honour of God cannot be asked too often vntill we obtaine it. If it be good to ſay a good prayer once euery month, it is better to ſay it once a weeke; and if it be good to ſay it euery weeke, it is better to ſay it euery day, and better yet to ſay it euery hower; ſo that we hinder not more neceſſary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 28.</note> Lactantius who liued about a thouſand and three hundred yeares ſince, and was maſter to Conſtantine the Great, hath a diſcourſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to commende the often repeating of the Aue Mary.</p>
            <p>Fiftly they obiect that it taſteth of ſuperſtition to obſerue ſuch a number of prayers. I anſwere that it taſteth of ſuperſtition to none, but ſuch as are out of taſt with pious things, and with the deuotions of the Catholike Church: what ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition was it in ſaint Bartholomew and in ſaint Paul the Ermite to obſerue a certaine number of prayers euery day? An haeretike may call it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in Chriſt, to chooſe twelue Apoſtles correſponding to the twelue Tribes of Iſrael, or to pray thrice the ſame prayer in the Garden; for that the number of three is often vſed in the Scriptures to ſignifie the firmneſſe and ſtability of any thing, or in a Catholike to ſay three <hi>Pater noſters</hi> in honour of the three perſons of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, or ſiue in honour of the fiue wounds of our Lord. All which are as much ſuperſtitious, as to obſerue a certaine number of the Aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys in the Roſary, And much more ſuperſtitious doth it outwardly appeare, for Ioſue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande twelue men to take vp twelue ſtones out
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:98706:308"/>of lordan, and to lay downe other twelue in their places, to ſignify the twelue Tribes, then to ſay a hundred and fifty Aue Marys, in imitation of Dauids hundred and fifty Pſalmes. Yet who dare ſay that any of theſe things are ſuperſtitious? We muſt not goe by the outtward appearance; but by the intrinſecal to iudge of the malice of things. Chriſt muſt not be iudged a ſinner, becauſe he had the outward habite of a ſinner. The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why none of theſe things are ſuperſtitious is, becauſe there is nothing done in them, but which hath conexion and proportion to a good end, for which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and therefore to obſerue a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prayers in relation to ſome holy miſtery, not any of the actions aboue mentioned are in the ſpecies of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor haue the malice of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue proportion to a good end: which is to ſtirre vs vp to deuotion by the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pious things. Thus you ſee that the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roſary is well grounded vpon good, and holy miſterys, and that all obiections againſt it are vaine and groundles: as all muſt needes be that are obiected againſt the bleſſed Virgins ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Bleſſings are giuen to Beades, to determinate thoſe materiall things to pious vſes, which in themſelues are indifferent to any: for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the ornaments and veſſell of the Church ſeruice were commanded to be conſecrated in the law of Moyſes,
<note place="margin">

            <p>Euer ſince the Empreſſe of the world was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpted into Heauen, it hath bene the cuſtome of the Catholike Church, for all the people, both riche and poore, to beſeech her gracious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to pray to her: the holy to be ſtrenghtned in holines, and ſinners to he freed from ſinne: and as we haue through out the yeare diuerſe Feaſts which were aunciently by the holy Saints, and are now by vs obſerued in her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; ſoe to commend vnto all the deuotion of the Roſary Pope Gregory the XIII. of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly memory, appointed the firſt Sunday of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be kept in honour of it. For in the yeare of our Lord 1571 when the Catholike Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared deſtitute of humane helpe, and leaned one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the armes and ſtrength of her diuine Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; the Northerne parts of Europe being then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely fallen into hereſys, and the Turke comming on the otherſide with a formidable nauy to aſſalt her; it pleaſed God to defende the Catholike cauſe, and to couer our enemys in the ſea, by a glorious victory which we gott ouer the Turke ſurpaſſing vs in number and force, but inferiour by the diuine protection ouer vs, and by the power of our B, Lady then particularly called vpon. For the victory was gained on that day on which the Sodality of the Roſary was called together to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore eſpecially her aſſiſtance: and therefore the holineſſe of the foreſaid Pope dedicated it as ſolemne to the Roſary: shewing in two things

<note place="margin">Diuerſe kinds of Sacrifice.</note> Firſt there are ſpiritual ſacrifices, to wit our inward thoughts and good purpoſes. And ſoe King Dauid ſayth that an humbled ſpirit and contrite hart (that is to ſay an act of humility and Contrition) is a Sacrifice to God. And S. Peter writing vnto all the faithfull requireth of them, that they be a holy Prieſthood by this kind of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſice.

                  <hi>Be ye a holy prieſthood to offer vp ſpirituall hoſts.</hi> There are alſo diuerſe ſorts of corporal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. Firſt ſuch as vocal prayer, kneeling, adoring, offering of gifts and the like. which as they are corporal worships, they may be called Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a large ſenſe: and S. Auguſtine ſayeth that euery good worke is a true Sacrifice: nor that it hath truely the nature of a Sacrifice; but that it is an offering with fruit and good effect to our ſoules; and not a falſe Sacrifice without fruit: as Chriſt ſaid of himſelfe that he was a true vine, that was to ſay a good vine that bringeth fruit; and not an ill vine which falſifyeth the hopes of it. But nene of
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:98706:310"/>theſe, neither ſpiritual nor corporal are properly Sacrifices, but onely in an vnpropper and large ſenſe; in that they are good works offered vp to God; but they are not offered as the higheſt worship propper onely to him; but may be, and are in their kind giuen to men; as when we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship our friends both in our harts, and with our bodys; and when we offer gifts to our ſuperiors; as the Kings did to Chriſt their ſuperiour euen as man; but propper Sacrifices are offered to none but God. A Sacrifice therefor properly ſpeaking is the offering vp of ſome corporal and ſenſible thinge, as the ſupreme and propper worship of God. The Maſſe then is a Sacrifice in its true and propper ſenſe: that is to ſay the offering vp of ſome corporal thinge, as an act of higheſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, ſpecial and propper onely to God, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge diuine power in him. And thus a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice may be vnderſtoode two wayes: either for the action of offering and Sacrifizing; or els for the thinge that is offered and Scrifized: as the word Offering is ſometimes taken for the action of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; as when we ſay he was long or short, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or tedious in his offering: and is ſometimes taken for the thinge that is offered, as when we ſay it was a rich or poore offering. Soe the Maſſe is a Sacrifice vnderſtanding the action of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. (And ſoe all the prayers and caeremonys of Maſſe are parts of it, belonging to its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity as it is ſuch a manner of Sacriſizing and offering:) and for the thinge offered it is the true body and blood of our Lord vnder the ſigne of bread and wine. Soe that both the Maſſe is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:98706:311"/>and the body and blood of our Lord is a Sacrifice. The Maſſe is a Sacrifice that is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacrifizing; the body and blood of our Lord is a Sacrifice, that is the thinge which is Sacrifized, or offered at Maſſe.</p>
               <p>The worship of Sacrifice hath bene eſteemed at all times, and by all religions ſoe neceſſary to be giuen to God, that there neuer was any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world (according to Turſeline) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Turks ſoe Barbarous; but as they allwais worshipped ſome God, ſoe they offered ſome kind of Sacrifice to him: in ſoe much that Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch could ſay that <hi>it was eaſier to finde cittys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out temples,</hi>

               <head>ALL TRVE SACRIFICES BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt were but Types and Emblemes of honour, to ſetforth the dignity of our Sacrifice.</head>
               <p>THE Sacrifices of the Law of Nature, and of the Law of Moyſes were good and holy Sacrifices: yet as thoſe Lawes, did but ſignify the more perfect Law of Chriſt which was to come; ſoe their Sacrifices, which were the cheife things of thoſe Lawes, were but figures of ours. Their Sacrifices of Beeues, Calues, Rammes, Lambes, Turtles, and the like, were killed and their blood was shed vpon the Altare to ſignify the Lambe of God, whoſe blood was to be shed vpon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare of the Croſſe. There were in the Law of Moyſes three kindes of Sacrifices: the Holocauſt, the Placable hoſt, and the Peaceable hoſt. The Holocauſt is as much as to ſay <hi>all burnt.</hi> For it was not offered for any particular end or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely to giue ſupreme honour to God; and therefore it was all totally conſumed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of him. The Placable hoſt was to appeaſe the diuine wrath when by ſome ſinne they had offended him: and it was diuided, part of it being conſumed to God, and part giuen to the Prieſt; to ſignify that the remiſſion of ſinnes proceedeth cheifly from God, as the principal cauſe; and ſecondarily from Prieſts, as the inſtruments and meanes, by which his poweris applyed to vs. The Pacifique or Peaceable hoſt was offered
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:98706:312"/>for the obtaining of ſome benefit which they deſired, or in thanks-giuing for ſome which they had obtained: and it was diuided into three parts: the one of which was conſumed to God, another was giuen to the Prieſt, and another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to the party that offered it: to ſignify that all benefits proceede from God by the help of Prieſts, and by our owne endeauours concurring with them.</p>
               <p>All theſe Sacrifices were fullfilled in ours: to wit in the ſacred Body of Chriſt our Sauiour. He was our Holocauſt quite conſumed in his death vpon the Croſſe: he was our Placable hoſt that appeaſed the wrath of God againſt vs: he our Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable hoſt by whom we haue all benefits. Their bloody Sacrifices more expreſly ſignifyed his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as it is was offered on the Croſſe: and their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody Sacrifices of firſt fruits, corne, flower, bread, and the like, repreſented more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame body, as it is offered after an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody manner vpon the holy Altare at Maſſe. But the Planeſt figure of the Sacrifice of Maſſe was a Lambe with Bread and Wine, offered euery day in the Law of Moyſes, to ſignify the Lambe of God offered vnder the ſignes of bread and wine, as the daily and continuall Sacrifice of the Law of Chriſt, then to come. Our Sacrifice then is the ſubſtance of thoſe shaddowes, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious myſtery which they were to ſignify. This S. Andrew the Apoſtle of Chriſt profeſſed as the Prieſts of Achaia in his Martyrdome rehearſe, when being vrged by Aegeas to offer Sacrifice to Idols, he had this anſwere ready for him. <hi>I offer
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:98706:313"/>euery day vpon the Altare an immaculate Lambe, whoſe flesh when all the people haue eaten, the Lambe that was ſacrifyzed remaineth whole and aliue.</hi> Thus did he glory in our immaculate Lambe, which euery day as a Prieſt he offered, and which the people then vſed euery day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. And in theſe words he planely intimateth that the ſacrifices of the Law of Nature, and of Moyſes, and eſpecially that of the daily Lambe were but ſigures to dicipher, shaddows to denote, and emblemes of honour to ſetforth the dignity of ours, that was then to come, a Sacrifice like them, but infinitly more perfect And thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices being shaddowes of ours then to come, they were to vanish away and to be offered noe more when it once came: becauſe then they loſt their nature, which was to ſignify ours as future. But the holy Sacrifice of Maſſe repreſenting noe other future Sacrifice, and being the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all Sacrifices can neuer be made voide by any, nor shall euer haue an end, vntill the end of the world. But we will shew</p>

               <head>THAT THE SACRED BODY OF our Lord, as it is offered at Maſſe, is a true Sacrifice.</head>
               <p>THE moderne enemys of the Catholike Church reiect the holy Sacrifice of the Euchariſt at Maſſe; ſoe that granting that which was offered on the Croſſe, they deny for euer after all Sacrifice to the Law of Chriſt. They grant
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:98706:313"/>in this that which is true indeede, that the Law of Chriſt was founded vpon the ſacrifice of the Cros as offered for our redemption; but denying any ſacrifice to continue afterwards in that Law, they deny the continuance of the ſupreme worship of God in it, which nations haue euer vnderſtoode by Sacrifice. They doe in this, as though ſome people should chooſe a king, and should promiſe vnto him a glorious reigne amongſt them, and then should honour him with Royal and Souerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne worship, but for one day or one hower only; ſoe they profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a glorious Kingdome of God among them; and then they giue him the ſupreme homage of Sacrifice but once onely, to wit for that day and hower on which Chriſt ſuffered death. It had bene the part of good Chriſtians (that being a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, was to be ſome corporall thing offered to God as his cheife and higheſt homage) to haue bene thinking, which of all corporall things in the world was moſt perfect, and to haue thought it moſt worthy to be the continuall Sacrifice of the Law of Chriſt, rather then to haue denyed a continuall Sacrifice at all to it. This was the Sonne of God from all eternity thinking, and contriuing to effect; and he effected it; when hee inſtituted his owne ſacred Body to be conteined in the Euchariſt, and ſoe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue vnto the conſummation of the world with vs, that we might allwais haue a moſt myſterious, miraculous, and glorious Sacrifice, the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all corporall things, worthy of his diuine Law, to be daily offered in it. And ſo he prouid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:98706:314"/>a Sacrifice for his people more perfect then euer any people had before, the moſt perfect which any can haue, and which in ſome ſenſe may be ſaid to be infinitly perfect. This had bene a thought worthy of a Chriſtian, and not to deny à Sacrifice in which the ſupreme worship of God conſiſteth, to continue allwaies in the Faith of Chriſt; and to ioyne with the Turks onely, who haue a Law without a continuall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. But wee will shew by the Scriptures, Church, and Fathers, that the Euchariſticall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Maſſe is a true Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The holy King and Prophet miſteriouſly deſcribeth it in theſe words. <hi>Our Lord ſware, and it shall not repent him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 109.</note> 
                  <hi>thou art a Prieſt for euer according to the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> Who hath ſworne? our Lord God. It muſt be true then that which is ſworne. What hath he ſworne? that Chriſt is a Prieſt. For how long? for euer, offering by the hands of Prieſts. What kind of Prieſt was Chriſt and his Prieſts to be? they were to be of the order of Melchiſedech. What or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was that? what kind of Sacrifice did Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech offer? Read the 14. of Geneſis, and you shall finde that Melchiſedechs Sacrifice was in bread and wine. Soe that the Sacrifice of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Prieſts was to be according to it. Let now the enemys of the Catholike Church shew any action of the life of Chriſt, or any myſtery in his Church, if they can, that accordeth with Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedechs Sacrifice, except it were at his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that he then offered the Euchariſt as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſice, and left it as a Sacrifice to be offered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:98706:314"/>at all times, by his Prieſts in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. Take away that Sacrifice, and we haue none at all left according to Melchiſedechs, nor noe Prieſts according to his order. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt therefore is the ſacrifice which the Prophet was inſpired to deſcribe after this myſterious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to be according to the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech in the Prieſts that offered it.

So that it was not onely for the future to be offered; but euen then was offered as a Sacrifice; and it was afterwards to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as then. But that which is to be obſerued, as moſt manifeſtly conuincing againſt our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of England is, that we being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to doe it for a commemoration of him; that is to ſay of his being offered on the Croſſe at his death, and he being then alſo according to our enemys offered as a Sacrifice: what comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of that offering doe they make in the Euchariſt, who make it no Sacrifice, nor offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all? Catholiks ſay that as the true Body of our Lord was truely offered as a Sacrifice on the Croſſe. So in the Euchariſt it is truely offered as a Sacrifice at Maſſe: Proteſtants ſay that his true Body is neither truely offered as a Sacrifice
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:98706:315"/>at Maſſe, nor is the Euchariſt any Sacrifice at all, nor yet is he ſoe much as preſent in it. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration doe they make according to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his death on the Cros, where he was both truely preſent and a true Sacrifice? The truth is that they laboring to pull downe the Maſſe, as the cheife and higheſt worship of God which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church had, regarded not to take away all commemoration of Chriſts Paſſion, and to leaue the world for euer after without any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at all.</p>

Bede who liued after them, although about a thouſand yeares ſince, relateth a notable hiſtoty to ſetforth the power of the Maſſe. The ſumme of which is, that a Gentleman who ſerued the King of Northumberland in his warres being ſore
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:98706:316"/>wounded in batle, was taken by the enemy and recouering of his wounds, was ſold vnto a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of London. His brother who was a Prieſt, thinking him to haue bene killed, ſaid euery day Maſſe for him: and to shew the power, and eſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Maſſe in looſing of the ſoule from punishments in the next world, it pleaſed God that allwais at that time of day in which his brother ſaid Maſſe for him the fetters with which he was bounde, of their owne accord, were looſed from him: in ſoe much that is patrone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing it, and acknowledging ſome myſtery in it, gaue leaue to his bondsman to goe amongſt his freinds to procure his ranſome.

Bede ſaith he knew it to be, it muſt manifeſtly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for the dignity, power and efficacy of the Maſſe, according as it is vſed in the Catholike Church, and that it is a Sacrificè, as we beleeue it to be. Finally the Maſſe is ſoe auncient, and ſoe planely teſtifyed by the primitiue fathers of the Church of Chriſt, that a Proteſtant authour Confeſſeth <hi>that noe beginning there of after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times can be shewen.</hi>

We shew by ſuch writers that it was the doctrine of the auncient Catholiks, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it to be true; becauſe the whole Catholike Church doth ſoe beleeue. And this whole Church was contradicted by Caluin, when he beganne his doctrine in oppoſition, and diſobedience to all the Churches of the world.</p>
               <p>And for this I will adde further the words of the Apoſtle <hi>we haue an altare,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>where of they haue not power to cate that ſerue the tabernacle</hi> He ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there to ſome, who being conuerted from Iudaiſme to the faith of Chriſt, were ſtill inclining to the Iewish Sacrifices; and to diſſwade them from this, he compareth together their altare and ours, and preferreth ours. By which it is manifeſt that we had a Sacrifice in the Apoſtles times: for what are altares for, but to offer Sacrifice on? and the Apoſtle comparing theſe two altares together, muſt ſuppoſe and vnderſtande their Sacrifices by them: for the altares are not eaten, but the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which are offered on them; and therefor as the Iewish altare had a Sacrifice which was eaten; ſoe had the altare of the Apoſtles; or els there is noe compariſon betwixt the two altares, nor
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:98706:317"/>connexion in the Apoſtles ſpeech.</p>
               <p>To the former authoritys I adde this reaſon. The worship of Sacrifice hath allwais bene vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode as the cheife and higheſt worship of God: but the true Church of Chriſt muſt haue at all times the cheife and higheſt worship of God; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor the true Church of Chriſt muſt haue at all times the worship of Sacrifice. Neither can there any good anſwere be made to this argument. For if they ſay that Chriſt as he was once offered on the Cros, is the Chriſtian Sacrifice ſufficient for vs; and therefor we neede none after it: it is not a good anſwere, nor ſatisfyeth any more, then if one should ſay Chriſt worshipped God for vs; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor we neede not to worship God after him: or Chriſt faſted, prayed and ſuffered for vs; therefor we neede not to faſt, or to pray, or to doe any good works; but onely to beleeue in him, and we shall be ſaued: and ſoe we should banish the worship of God, and all good works out of the world, and ſet vp a ſole and onely iuſtifying faith, as they doe grounding themſelues vpon ſuch vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and friuolous inferences of their owne braine, which they will mainteine againſt all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole world. Chriſt ſaued vs by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Cros; that is by the merits of that Sacrifice he procured meanes for our ſaluation: and theſe meanes are faith and good works; and the beſt of all works and moſt honorable to God is the offering of a Sacrifice. And as Chriſts wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and good works doe not hinder and cua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate ours, noe more did his Sacrifice hinder and cuacuate all Sacrifice for euer after: but he would
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:98706:318"/>inſtitute a ſacrifice for his people, that by it they might apply the merits of his ſacrifice to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? and that it might be the moſt worthy of all ſacrifices, he ordained it to be in his owne ſacred body, myſteriouſly, yet really offered in the Euchariſt. Which as it was the moſt perfect of all corporall things, was indeed the moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſacrifice for the Law of Chriſt; yet if we did not offer that body as then truely and really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with vs; but offered it in our harts onely, as it was preſent on the Croſſe, and as it is now in Heauen, it were not the offering of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent corporall thing, as all people haue euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode a ſacrifice to be,</p>
               <p>Hence it appeareth how vainly they obiect the wordsof the Apoſtle calling Chriſtour High Prieſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>who by one oblation hath conſummated for euer thoſe that are ſanctifyed.</hi> Therefore (ſay they) all other oblation is needleſſe, and derogateth from that of Chriſt, as though it were not ſufficient. To which it is anſwered that the words of the Apoſtle are moſt holy and true. Chriſt is our high Prieſt, and our onely high Prieſt; for the higheſt of all others Prieſts is but the Vicar of Chriſt our Higheſt Prieſt. He conſummated by way of redemption the ſanctification of all thoſe that are ſanctifyed, and by one onely oblation he ſaued all that are ſaued, in that by it onely he redeemed vs. What then? Therefore there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no more ſacrifice for our redemption. It is true. Therefore all other ſacrifice for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption derogateth from that. It is alſo true. And this is all that the Apoſtle ſayeth, Where is
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:98706:318"/>now their argument? Therefor there needeth noe continuall ſacrifice to conſerue the worship of God, and to giue ſupreme and due homage to him. It is falſe, and no better conſequence, then as I ſaid before, Chriſt worshipped God for vs; therefor we neede not to worship him. The cheife worship of God is by ſacrifice, and this worship was giuen him by Chriſt for vs, is it now good conſequence? Therefor we neede not to giue that cheife worship to God. Chriſt offered ſacrifice for our redemption; but to receiue the benefit of it, we muſt doe our parts, and that is as I haue ſaid to receiue the Sacraments, offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and doe other works, which he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done by vs in the Catholike Church, for the honour of God, and the ſanctifying of our ſoules: and therefor ſaint Iohn attributeth our ſanctification to our ſelues.

               <p>This although it be a commemoratiue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatiue ſacrifice repreſenting and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating hisbeing offered on the Cros; yet that bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not but it is a true Sacrifice, as that was, and of the very ſame thing after a different manner offered. For if the figuratiue ſacrifices of the law of Moyſes were true ſacrifices, which repreſented this not as yet come, but when it was to come after many hundreds of yeares; how much more may that of the laſt ſupper be a true ſacrifice, which repreſented it as immediatly to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? and how much more may ours be a true ſacrifice which repreſenteth it, as all ready of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? Thoſe were repreſentations of a true ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yet themſelues alſo true ſacrifices: therefore
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:98706:320"/>it is not contrary to the nature of a ſacrifice, to be the repreſentation of a ſacrifice. But they ſay that the ſacrifices before Chriſt were true and reall creatures repreſenting a future ſacrifice different from them; but we ſay that we offer vp the ſame thing that is repreſented in it; how can it be the ſame, and yet a repreſentation of it? Yes! we offer vp the ſame Body, that was offered on the Croſſe, and repreſent the ſame body offered in a different manner. The ſame thing in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate and condition may repreſent it ſelfe, as it was before, or shall be bereafter in another manner and ſtate. If a champion that had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his enemy, should repreſent afterwards the manner of his encounter, then he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent himſelfe in a different ſtate, and that which repreſented should be the ſame, as the thing which it did repreſent. If Dauid for his greater glory had in his owne perſon exhibited to the people his victory ouer the Philiſthaean Gyant, then he had bene both a repreſentation of Dauid, and true Dauid repreſenting the victory which himſelfe had gotten: ſo the Body of our Lord, as it is offered at Maſſe, repreſenteth it ſelfe, as it was offered on the Croſſe, and is the ſame in a different manner and ſtate: on the Croſſe it was after a cruell and bloody manner, as fighting; on the Altare it is after an vnbloody manner, as in peace after the victory. Thus alſo the ſame ſacred Body of our Lord in his glorious Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration repreſented it ſelfe, as it was to be in the ſtate of glory afterwards. Soe that the ſame thing may repreſent it ſelfe; and the Maſſe may be
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:98706:320"/>a repreſentatiue and commemoratiue ſacrifice of that of the Cros, and yet offer the ſame thing that was then offered. Nay by how much more vnion that which repreſenteth hath to that which it doth repreſent, the more liuely and naturall is the repreſentation of it; as it were a more liuely and naturall repreſentation of Dauids victory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by himſelfe, then by another; becauſe it had more connexion and relation to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer action.</p>
               <p>The being therefore a commemoratiue, and repreſentatiue ſacrifice doth not hinder the Maſſe for being a true ſacrifice, of the ſame thing which is repreſented in it. It repreſenteth the oblation of the Croſſe, and in all places whereſoeuer Maſſe is ſaid, there the death of our Redeemer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated, and the ſame thing is offered all ouer, and the very ſame that was offered on the Croſſe. The words of S. Chryſoſtome shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this point of the Chriſtian doctrine. <hi>What doe we?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe not we offer euery day? we doe offer indeede,</hi>

                  <hi>and that in commemoration of his death.</hi> And <hi>this is but one hoſt and not many; becauſe he was but once offered: and this Sacrifice is an example of that. We offer ſtill the ſame thing, not to day one Lambe and to morrow another, but allways the very ſame. Becauſe it is offered in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, are there therefore many Chriſts? No! but the ſame Chriſt. Here he is intirely, and there intirely the ſame body.</hi> This is enough in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Catholike verity, and we will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute no more of it, but bleſſe God for it. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende then, ô Chriſtian, and conſider the diuine
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:98706:321"/>loue to thee, and how much thou art honoured in this miſtery.

               <p>BEFORE that I ſpeake of the parts, and ceremonys of the Maſſe in particular, I will ſay ſomething of the nature of ceremonys in generall. The vſe of ceremonys in the ſeruice of God is grounded vpon the condition of our nature: for man being a corporall creature muſt honour God according to his nature, after a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall manner Angels onely by intellectuall, and and ſpirituall acts honour God; becauſe they are onely Spirits; but men being both ſpirituall and corporall, both ſpiritually and corporally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to there nature muſt honour him: ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with inward acts of minde, and corporally with outward actions of the body: and therefore we pray not onely by ſpirituall and mentall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:98706:321"/>as the Angels doe; but alſo with vocall words, and vſe ceremonys to ſignify outwardly our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reuerence to the myſterys which are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by them. So that ceremonys are in vertue and effect words, being altogether as proper ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes. and indeede more naturall to expreſſe our affections, then words are. The Sonne of God hauing aſſumed the nature of man by humane actions glorifyed his Father; not onely ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with his minde; but alſo corporally with his body, by words, and ceremonys when he prayed: ſometimes lifting vp his hands, ſometimes his eyes, ſometimes kneeling, and proſtrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and he iuſtifyed the like ceremonys in his diſciples; as when in that glorious ſolemnity, in which they and the Hebrew children conducted him ſolemnly into Hieruſalem, they vſed both words and ceremonys to expreſſe their affection, and ioy in him.

                  <hi>Kiſſe thou gaueſt mee not; with oile thou didſt not annoint my head.</hi> Theſe deuout ceremonys were teſtimonys of the much loue of God, which was in her, and had the effect of words to obtaine the remiſſion of many ſinnes, So the ceremonys of the Church are teſtimonys of our affection to God, and dutys of nature, which we owe to him: and thoſe that haue relation to ſome particular myſtery; as the ſigne of the Croſſe, and thoſe of the Maſſe haue to the Paſſion of Chriſt, moue vs to a deuout remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that which they repreſent. For as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob ſet rods of diuerſe colours before his sheepe that beholding them they might bringforth lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes of diuerſe colourslike them; ſo the Church of God by thoſe ceremonys ſetteth good and holy obiects before our eyes, that wee may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoughts and affections like them. I haue ſpoken of ceremonys in the fift diſcourſe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Baptiſme, and I neede not now to repeate the ſame things ouer againe. If therefore the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonys of Maſſe repreſent pious and holy myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terys they are pious and to bee allowed of. There remaineth then onely to expounde the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys of Maſſe, and to shew that they ſignify holy myſterys.</p>
               <p>Before Maſſe the Prieſt changeth his habite for two reaſons.
<note place="margin">The Prieſts habite.</note> Firſt, to ſignify the expoliation of the old man; that is the putting of of his former ſinnes, and the putting on of the new man in newneſſe of life and vertues, the ornaments of our ſoules. Secondly, his outwards ornaments are alſo in honour and reuerence to the myſterys
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:98706:322"/>which he handleth; that he may appeare with comlineſſe, beauty, and glory in the diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and therefore God commanded Moyſes to make veſtures of pretious matter to Aaron,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.</note> and his ſonnes, adorned richly with gold and jewels, for <hi>glory and beauty</hi> to exerciſe their functions of Prieſthood in. Their Prieſthood was but the shaddow of ours: our ſacrifice is infinitly more perfect; and therefor deſerueth more beauty, and glory in the Prieſts that offer it.</p>
               <p>The ornaments which God appointed for them ſignifyed many morall vertues, commended eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to Prieſts by them: and ſo doe ours as may be ſeene in Authours, who haue moralized on them. But that which is moſt to be obſerued is the relation which they haue to the Paſſion of Chriſt: for the Church intending to doe that myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in commemoration of his death vſeth ſuch veſtments, as may put vs in minde of it.
<note place="margin">The Amict</note> The Amict, which he putteth firſt ouer his head about his necke, ſignifyeth the cloth with which our Sauiour was blindfolded, when they ſtriking him bad him gueſſe, who it was that ſtrucke him. The Prieſt croſſeth it ouer his breaſt, to ſixe at it were in his hart a loue and reuerence to the Croſſe of Chriſt. And alſo to shew the prompt obedience, and willingneſſe of hart with which he vnderwent the ſorrowes of his Paſſion euen ſtraitened with the deſire of that painfull baptiſme.
<note place="margin">The Albe.</note> The Albe ſignifyeth the long white garment, which Herod and his court ſcorned him in. For they deſiring to ſee ſome miracles wrought by him; Pilate ſent him to them: but he not anſwering to their
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:98706:323"/>curious deſire, nor shewing any miracles then to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſcoffed at him, and whit a long white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that trailed vnder his feete, they ſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back as a ſpectacle of deriſion; the King of glory being veſted as a foole.
<note place="margin">The Girdle.</note> The Girdle ſignifyeth the ropes with which he was bound in the garden, when they apprehended him, as a malefactour to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for life.
<note place="margin">The Manicle.</note> The Manicle ſignifieth the cords with which his hands were faſtened to a pillar, that they might haue his whole body better to hitt, and to wounde at their pleaſure.
<note place="margin">The Stole.</note> The Stole ſignifieth his carrying of the Croſſe, when they led him, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pulled him through the ſtreets of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with his Croſſe on his shoulders.
<note place="margin">The Veſtment.</note> The Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or vpper garment ſignifyeth the purple which in ſcorne they putt about him. For the Iewes hauing obtained their deſire of Pilate, to wit, that Chriſt should be deliuered to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; to cleere themſelues as though ſakleſſe of his death, they deliuered him to the Pagane ſouldiers guard, to be abuſed and executed by them: who carrying him into an outward court, they faſtened vnto his head a crowne of thornes, put a reede into his hand, a purple coate about him, and then in mockery they kneeled downe, and ſaid <hi>all haile King of the I wes,</hi> ſpitting in his face, and beating him about the head with canes.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt being thus veſted with the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of Chriſts Paſſion com'sforth as an Angell of God to declare the diuine myſterys; but in better termes then any Angell can declare them: for that which he ſayeth are the words of the Holy
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:98706:323"/>Ghoſt deliuered to him by the Church; and that which he doth is more then any Angell can doe. He commeth to the altare as to the Cros of Chriſt to offer him vp on it.
<note place="margin">The Altare.</note> The altare is of ſtone to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that Chriſt is the rooke vpon which our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is builded,
<note place="margin">Oyle.</note> and the corner ſtone by which all that will, both Iewes and Gentils are vnited vnto ſalvation. It is conſecrated with oile to ſignify the ſpirituall vnction of the holy ghoſt annointing, and curing vs with the oile of grace. And therefor oile is often vſed in the conſecrating of holy things, to ſignify the diuine grace, which as a pretious and ſoueraigne oile is powred into our harts, tendering them to the loue and ſeruice of God, by the deuout vſage of thoſe things.

               <p>Firſt the Prieſt commeth downe before the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, and doing reuerence to it,

And hauing by deuout verſicles, and anſweres mutually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended each other to God in their prayers, he goeth vp praying in priuate for the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and that he may worthily aſcende vnto the altare.</p>
               <p>The altare as I haue ſaid ſignifyeth the Cros on which Chriſt was offered:

<note place="margin">Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon the Maſſe</note> and deuotion to be preſent at Maſſe, and to attend diligently and to meditate vpon thoſe myſterys, as though wee were (as wee are indeede) in the preſence of Chriſt himſelfe, and that we ſaw him viſibly in all thoſe paſſages, which are then cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated: that we may be aſtonished with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and burne with the loue of him, who did and ſuffered thoſe things for vs. Vntill <hi>the Gloria in excelſis</hi> we will imagine that we ſaw the Saints who were before Chriſt reioycing in the hopes of him, and that we heard their cryes and prayers for his comming. At the <hi>Gloria in excelſis,</hi> we will awaken our ſelues with the Angels voyces to a higher ioy imagining that we heard the Angell tell the newſe of his birth to the Sheepheards, and the multitude of the celeſtiall army ſinging thoſe words with the Prieſt, and we will offer our ſelues then to Chriſt, to be his ſeruants all the dayes of our life. Vntill the Ghoſpell we will thinke that we were following him, and our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lady, behauing our ſelues as his ſeruants, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with the ſanctity of his conuerſation. At the Ghoſpell and Creede we will imagine that we
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:98706:333"/>heard him preach, and ſaw the power of God draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the harts of others to him. At the Praeface that we were at his glorious entrance into Hieruſalem, and we will ſing with his diſciples, and with the people, <hi>Bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of our Lord.

At the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration and eleuation, we will thinke that we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at his death, heard the cry which he gaue, and ſaw him hang downe his head and dy: and that we heard the toppe of the temple and rooks about Hieruſalem to rent in pieces, and perceiued the earthquake and the riſing of dead bodys, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable darknes then couering all things, and we may thinke how greeuous our ſins were, that were the cauſe of all this. After the conſecration we will make acts of the loue of God and purpoſes to ſerue him, and to mende our life, and ſome greater falts in particular. And we will prepare our ſelues to receiue the bleſſed Sacrament if not corporally, at leaſt ſpiritually by an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of it. At the Poſtcommunion we will giue thanks with the Prieſt, and calling to minde the reſurrection of Chriſt, wee will riſe with alacrity to a better life. At the <hi>ite Miſſa eſt,</hi> and the Prieſts benediction, we will imagine our ſelues preſent at Chriſts Aſcenſion, and hauing with his

God inſpireth the Church in the vſe of this, as he did vnto them the vſe of the former, and ſo they are both of God, (ſee diſc 4. art. 9. &amp; diſc. 11. of the authority of the Church.) The Church vſeth ſuch like obſeruations and rites, not as Sacraments, to reſtore vs to the diuine grace, when we haue loſt it; but as holy actions to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance vs further in the diuine grace which wee haue; (and conſequently to remitte leſſer ſinnes, which are compatible with grace) ſanctifying vs more in the ſight of God,

               <head>WHY THE MASSE IS SAID in Latine.</head>
               <p>THE Maſſe is ſaid in Latine for diuerſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, for that the Church is Catholike, that is to ſay vniuerſall, not of one nation, but of all; and therefore it is moſt conuenient that she should prayſe God, and haue her ſeruice in a language which is moſt generall, and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally vnderſtoode, and eſteemed of by all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and this is the Latine tongue. An English Catholike may go into Italy, France, Spaine, or into any place of the Catholike world euen into
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:98706:335"/>the furtheſt Indys; and as he is vnited in the ſame faith and doctrine, and obeyeth the ſame authority of the Church with them;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.</note> ſo he shall ſee the very ſelfe ſame ſeruice of God, and heare the very ſame words which he heareth in his owne countrey, and vnderſtande them, if he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the Latine tongue. This is the comfort of Catholiks, that they are <hi>the people of one ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and one ſpeech;</hi> not onely in faith and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but alſo in manner of vtterance, as neere as can be. Neither was it euer the practiſe of the Church to haue her ſeruice in the vulgar langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of euery nation. In the eaſterne parts of the world Maſſe was aunciently ſaid in Greeke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Greeke tongue was moſt vniuerſally vnderſtoode, and eſteemed of in thoſe parts; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the common ſort of people in all thoſe places generally vnderſtoode it not. In the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne parts of the world it was ſaid in Latine, as Saint Auguſtine ſayeth that the Scriptures were vſed in Affrica in Latine;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bed.</hi> 1. <hi>hiſt. Ang. cap.</hi> 1.</note> and Saint Bede ſaith that there being in England in S. Auguſtines time fower ſeuerall languages, by his preaching, and ſaying ſeruice in the Latine tongue, it came commune to them all. For this reaſon the Maſſe is ſaid all ouer in Latine, except perhaps in ſome places of Greece, or where the Latine tongue is but litle ſtudied.</p>
               <p>Secondly a higher and more eſteemed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage giueth more maieſty, and reuerence to the miſterys of God, then a vulgar tongue; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by the Scriptures, would vſe a moſt high and maieſticall manner of
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:98706:336"/>ſpeech, for the moſt part aboue vulgar capacitys: and the Catholike Church ſpeaking in the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, it is meete, that she should vſe his manner of ſpeech,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Church ſeruice were to be ſaid in euery vulgar tongue, it would be ſubiect to continuall miſconſtructions abuſed by the prowd and contentious, who being for the moſt part of the ignorant ſort, as regarding more the shew of knowledge, then the ſubſtance and good vſe of it, would pretende to vnderſtande all things, and contend without end. As now we ſee in England, where euery old wife (to uſe S. Hieromes words) preſumeth to teach that which she neuer learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thinketh that she hath braines enough to looke downe into that great depth of the Scriptures, which the Doctours of the Church haue ſo much admired, and which S.

The Proteſtants Miuiſters may now ſee and I know where ſome of them haue confeſſed the originall cauſe of this confuſion amongſt them, to haue bene the vnlimitated reading of the Scriptures, and the hauing of their common ſeruice in the
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:98706:336"/>vulgar tongue, and that it was an errour in their predeceſſors to put ſuch kniues into childrens hands, that could not vſe them, The Catholike Church as a carefull mother her ſelfe carueth for her children, inſtructing them in that which is neceſſary for them, not truſting them to their owne caruings and miſconſtructions.

               <p>Fourthly, if the Church Lyturgy were to be ſaid in euery vulgar tongue few Prieſts could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their functions out of their countreys. An Italian Prieſt could not ſay Maſſe in Spaine, nor a Spaniard in Italy. And this is the reaſon why ſo few Proteſtant Miniſters euer trauaile out of their countreys, Although it be thither where their owne Religion, as they prerende is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed: for their ſeruice being in a different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which that people vnderſtandeth not, they muſt either be ſilent abroade or ſtay at home, If they will ſay ſeruice. Where as Catholike Prieſts may ſerue God after the ſame manner in all places, and all people may ſerue God by them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if the publike ſeruice of the Church were ſaid in euery vulgar tongue, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be ſubiect to all thoſe alterations, and corruptions, which all vulgar tongues are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto; and which the Latine tongue was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto, as long as it was vulgarly ſpoken, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till in the end it banished it ſelfe quite out of the world, and was left as the common ſpeech
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:98706:337"/>of noe place: and then was kept in its integrity, and auncient purity by being kept from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and cheifly as we may well thinke, by hauing the Maſſe ſoe continually ſaid in Laaine.</p>
               <p>Where as our aduerſarys obiect the authority of S. Paul, Cor. 1.14 who ſeemeth as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to require that the Church ſeruice be in euery commune tongue, that all the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it may anſwere <hi>Amen;</hi> the Apoſtle neuer ſoe much as mentioneth the Church ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in that place, nor medleth with the language of it; but ſpeaketh there of quite another thinge; to wit the gift of ſtrange tongues, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of them: which interpretation was a different gift and which the ſpeaker himſelfe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes had not. Theſe and other like graces being giuen to ſome in thoſe times, the people mette together to heare them exerciſed. But by litle and litle they beganne to be abuſed, and fell into diſorders: in ſoe much that ſome would ſpeake, that which could be interpreted by none; ſoe that it had noe ſenſe that could require <hi>Amen</hi> to be anſwered to; but was as not ſpoken at all, none being inſpired to interprete it. Now what connexion hath this with the publike ſeruice of the Church? which is without any diſorder at all, and in noe ſuch ſtrange tongue, but in a knowne and the moſt honored of all tongues, which is intelligible in it ſelfe, and moſt vniuerſally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and interpreted by thouſands, and which hath not onely the authority of the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of it; but alſo commanding it; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for with all reaſon shall be anſwered with <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  <pb n="631" facs="tcp:98706:337"/>Which the other being fallen into diſorders could not in reaſon be anſwered with; it being to the edification of none, as being vnderſtoode by none; when the miracle should haue conſiſted in vnderſtanding, and interpreting of it.</p>
               <p>I haue heard of ſome who haue bene ſoe bold, as to ſay, that the Prieſt praying in a tongue which the people vnderſtande not, may curſe them for any thinge they know, as well as bleſſe them But this is a bold and irreuerent ſpeech. For if it were an irreuerence to the Law, and to lawyers to talke of their curſing of their ignorant clients, when they pleade for them in termes which they vnderſtande not; much more is it an irreuerence to the Law of God, and to Prieſts that haue the keeping of it, to talke of their curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people when they pray for them in the language of the Church Beſides it is a very weake ſpeech, and vnworthy of a wiſe man: for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to accommodate euery word to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all men. And what should they ſay when they vnderſtoode not? and what should deafe men ſay that heard nor? it were to banish all order quite out of the world, and the being of a Church to make it ſubiect to euery particular mans cenſure The Prieſt if he change nothing, but ſayeth what the Church commandeth, can enrſe none: and we cannot in reaſon and charity ſuſpect him of changing any thinge, except he be ſuch an one as Luther or Caluin that durſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vpon them to change what they liſted in the Church, and to beginne new Churches.

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s, it is not ſuch a rare thinge in Catholike countreys,
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:98706:338"/>as it is here for lay people to vnderſtande Latine. I remember that I haue mette with a plowman holding his plow, who directed mee in my way deſcribing it in very elegant Latine, and with poore beggars who haue bene very ready in the Latine tongue. Mechanike men, in ſome places vnderſtande it ſoe frequently, that Maſſe can hardly be ſaid amongſt an indifferent number of people; but ſome that are preſent will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande Latine.</p>
               <p>Finally experience will anſwere all obiections, in that the Maſſe being, as it is, in a high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable language, and with thoſe deuout caere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys, is full of edification and much more mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deuotion then any thinge which our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys haue. This thoſe that are conuerted to the Catholike faith doe preſently finde in themſelues; and thoſe that are peruerted from it commonly shew in the looſneſſe of their liues, that there is noe compariſon betwixt the deuotion and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Maſſe, and the prayers of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but onely ſuch as is betwixt true and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fire: the one of which warmeth indeede, the other warmeth not at all, but rather cooleth; as one should grow colder by holding his hands to a painted fire. Now it is fitting that we ſpeake a word or two</p>

               <head>OF THE FRVITS, AND BENEFITS, which are gained by the denout hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Maſſe.</head>
               <p>THERE is not any meanes in the world, ſoe efficacious for the obtaining of benefits at the hands of God, as the Maſſe is; both as it is a Sacrifice, the higheſt act of worship that can be giuen to God; and alſo as it is a Sacrifice ſoe eminent, and excelling all other Sacrifices, that the dignity, efficacy, and value of it can not be expreſſed: all benefits being infinitly more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be granted for it, then for any thinge that we can doe.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeake more in particular, firſt our faith is confirmed, and our mindes are eleuated to a feruerous zeale of that, which all Chriſtians profeſſe, when we commemorate the Paſſion of Chriſt in that deuout, and myſterious manner, as by the principall, and moſt expreſſe comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, which the Church hath of it. And we are excited to a firme and conſtant beleefe of that ſacred verity, which the Catholike Church hath allwais beleeued, of the true, reall, and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall preſence of the ſacred body, and blood of our Lord, and of his whole humane nature vnited to the diuine word in the B. Sacrament of Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Which as it is a myſtery aboue the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man, and not effected by any power of nature, but by the omnipotency of God; ſoe by it we yeeld our vnderſtandings captius, as we
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:98706:339"/>ought vnto the diuine power, to the word of God, and to the doctrine of the Church. And by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Maſſe we are not onely confirmed in this myſtery, but in all other points of the Chriſtian faith. For what is the whole Maſſe, but a daily exercizing, and training vp of chriſtians in the myſterys of Chriſt, and in all thoſe things which he did and ſuffered for vs? there is nothing there to be ſeene or heard, but the cheife myſterys of our faith repreſented, the diuine praiſes celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his benefits acknowledged, and his goodnes and mercy deuoutly implored: all with relation to ſome paſſage of his life or death.</p>
               <p>Secondly at Maſſe we are comforted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to hope confiding in God that hauing left vnto the world ſoe deere a pledge, as his onely Sonne he will grant vs the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and will giue vs in the end his bleſſed and glorious ſight, we purpoſing to vſe thoſe meanes, which he hath procured for our obtaining of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly at Maſſe we are inflamed vnto acts of charity, and vehement loue of God, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes ſuch a teſtimony of his loue towards vs; that he would ſend his beloued ſonne to take vpon him the imperfections of our nature, and to be ſoe vnworthily treated and killed to redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me vs that killed him. This should make the hart of a Chriſtian to melt with the loue of God: and without doubt it would doe ſoe, if we could right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, and apprehende it: and the whole ſcope of the Maſſe tendeth to this, to imprint in our mindes a liuely apprehenſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Paſſion. We then praiſe, and extoll in the
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:98706:339"/>higheſt manner that we can his ſacred merits: we ſet him in the ſight of God, and propoſe him as our mediatour before his eternall father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him that he will not looke vpon our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but vpon his owne deere Sonne, ſoe handled for the loue of vs, to obtaine our pardon, and to reconcile vs to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the Maſſe is a thanks giuing to God for the infinite and immenſe benefits which he beſtoweth allwais vpon vs, and eſpecially for the myſtery of the Incarnation. If we giue but a litle almes, or doe neuer ſoe ſmall a curteſy to our neighbour, we expect at leaſt to hatie thanks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned preſently for it. Why then shall not we be as thankefull to God, as we would haue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be to vs? and we hauing nothing of our owne with which we could worthily gratify the benefits of God; therefor Chriſt would leaue to vs the Sacrifice of his owne body, that in it we might haue a worthy offering, and a rich and pretious gift by which our gratitude might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly by being preſent at Maſſe we are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to repentance for our mortall ſinnes, and to come to the ſtate of grace by a good Confeſſion. For as the Iſraelits that were ſtung by the fiery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents were cured by beholding the brazen ſerpent erected; ſoe we by meditating vpon the Paſſion of our Sauiour, and by beholding him eleuated on the Cros, are cuted of the wounds of the fiery ſerpents of hell: and thoſe that heare Maſſe in the ſtate of grace obtaine a plentifull remiſſion
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:98706:340"/>of their venial ſinnes, much more then by any other good worke.</p>
               <p>Sixtly the Maſſe is not onely beneficiall to the liuing, but alſo to the dead, and the moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious worke of charity which can be done for them, by the generall commemoration which is then made for the ſoules of purgatory; and they when they are releaſed are not forgetfull of thoſe that helped them in miſery.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly thoſe that are preſent at Maſſe may receiue the B. Sacrament with more deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at leaſt ſpiritually in hart and minde, vniting themſelues with an ardent deſire to the life giuing flesh of our Sauiour; and noe doubt but shall carry away the effect of that ſacred foode in their harts. For as it were not fitting that thoſe who wait at the tables of Princes, or at great feaſts, should goe away hungry for want of meate; ſoe thoſe that attende at this bleſſed feaſt shall not depart vnſatiated with it; but euen as one that entreth into a wine cellar of ſtrong and pretious wines is comforted, and ſtrengthened with the ſtrength, and ſmell of them, although he taſt them not; ſoe thoſe that are preſent at this ſacred banquet ate ſpiritually refreshed, comforted, and filled with the vertue and ſtrength of the B. Sacrament, although corporally they receiue it not.</p>
               <p>Finally not onely the Prieſt that ſaith Maſſe, but all that are preſent offering vp that Maſſe with him, teceiue ſpirituall diſtributions at the hands of God, who giueth ſomething to euery one of
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:98706:340"/>them, for the offering which they gaue to him. And not onely ſpirituall, but alſo temporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are obtained by the Maſſe: becauſe as it is a Sacrifice it may be offered vp for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any good, or the auoiding of any euill whatſoeuer. Iacob offered Sacrifice for the good ſucceſſe of his iourney. Melchiſedech offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in thanks-giuing for his victory. Noe in thanks-giuing for his preſeruation in the deluge. Iob for his children. Sacrifices were offered for women before their deliuery, and after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery for their purification,

Saint Chryſoſtome mentioneth how that Sacrifice was offered in his time for the fruits of the earth, and for temperatnes of ayre. Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine relateth how that himſelfe cauſed it to be offered in houſes hanted with euill ſpirits, and that they were expelled by it. Saint Bede (as you haue heard) of a gentleman that was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly deliuered out of captiuity by hauing Maſſe ſaid for him. And Saint Anthony Archbishop of Florence, commonly called Saint Anthonine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth of the men, the one of which, who had not heard Maſſe on a holy day, was ſuddenly ſtrucke dead with thunder, and the other was ſaued by miracle for that he had heard Maſſe. By all which we may ſee that there is no kind of benefit, but it may be obtained by the Maſſe; and that there is nothing ſo efficacious for the obtaining of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits as to procure Maſſes to be ſaid for that end. And therefore it is a deuotion very acceptable
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:98706:341"/>to God that which many pious people haue of hearing Maſſe euery day: and (a deuotion which Saint Auguſtine hath commended in his mother Saint Monica, that she let no day paſſe without being preſent at the Sacrifice of the Church.) For as parents are pleaſed to ſee their children come euery day to acknowledge their ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to doe their filial duety to them, ſo it is a thing very pleaſing to God, to ſee vs his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come euery day as it were to aske his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the holy Sacrifice as the worship due and proper to him from vs: and as parents are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with tenderneſſe towards their children to pardon their falts, and to cherish and beſtow gifts on them, when they ſee them continue this daily ſubmiſſion and duety to them; ſo the loue and mercy of God muſt needs be moued towards vs, to pardon our ſinnes, and to beſtow graces vpon vs, when he ſeeth vs euery day at Maſſe. Wee ought then to conceiue a very great deuotion to this holy Sacrifice, and with all modeſty, ſilence and reuerence, to be preſent at it. Allways when we are going to Maſſe let vs thinke, that we are then going to preſent our ſelues before the diuine Maieſty to offer to him a very rich and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offering, the greateſt that is in the world: that which aſtonished heauen and earth, when it was offered on the Croſſe: and we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we were going to Mount Caluary, to ſee the very crucifying of Chriſt; and that ioyning our ſelues to the company of our bleſſed Lady, and of Saint Iohn Euangeliſt, wee will minde
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:98706:341"/>their behauiour and learne of them how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues at Maſſe. And it were good to gette a cuſtome allways when we heare Maſſe, to make a purpoſe of amending ſome particular falt, or imperfection, which we know in ourſelues, and to remember that purpoſe at the beginning, and at the end of euery Maſſe, which we heare.</p>

               <p>Nay the authority of God in many places of the Scriptures is in plaine words attributed to the Church. A queſtion ariſing concerning the neceſſity of Circumciſion, Saint Peter with ſome others mette at Hieruſalem about it: and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing decided the controuerſy they impoſed ſome praecepts to be obſerued by the Church; and that in the name and authority of the Holy Ghoſt; ſaying,

If a father should ſet a Schoole Maſter ouer his children, and commande them to obey him; they denying obedience to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be taught by him, diſobey their father, as well as their maſter.

<pb n="645" facs="tcp:98706:344"/>the world: for all order includeth ſubordination, that is to ſay ſubiection of inferiors to ſuperiour powers; but take once away the authority of the Church, and abſolue men in conſcience from the obedience of it, to beginne new doctrines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, teaching, and doeing what they liſt themſelues, and you take away all ſubordination of inferiors to ſuperiors in the diuine worship; therfore take away obedience to the Church, and you take away all order and gouernment in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, quite out of the world, by making men ſubiect to no authority; and conſequently you deſtroy the world which without order in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can not conſiſt.

               <p>Faſting is commended firſt in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſometimes by examples of the Prophets and holy men, and ſometimes by the admirable effects of it. Faſting was the firſt Praecept that was commanded to man, and all our miſerys beganne firſt by the vnhappy breaking of that Praecept. God might haue choſen any other Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to haue exercized our obedience in; but he would commende faſting to vs. After that, in the Law of nature it was commanded againe, ſome meates being then prohibited to be eaten, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.

The Nazareits and Recha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beits, who were particularly dedicated to the ſeruice of God, were ſtrict and auſtere in faſting. Holy Iudith armed with faſting went forth againſt all the Aſſyrian forces accompanyed onely with one maide ſeruant; and full of zeale, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly fortitude with her owne hands ſlew their Prince, and put them all to ſlight. The ſentence of death was giuen againſt all the Iſraelits, and a day appointed for their generall maſſacre; Eſther the Queene muſt venture her life for them, by going to the King to aske their pardon. She faſted and the people faſted for her good ſucceſſe, and she became ſoe beautifull and gracious, that the hart of the King being enamoured with her, the liues of thouſands were granted at her requeſt. The Niniuers for their ſinnes had deſerued deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, and God ſent his Prophet to declare againſt them, and to cry <hi>as yet forty dayes and

                  <note place="margin">

The three children armed with this vertue entred into the furnace of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and walked in the raging fire, as in a pleaſant fresh ayre. Daniel by faſting was too ſtrong for Lyons, and greedy hungar vrging them to deuoure, God ſtopped their mouths that they did him noe hurt. Graue Eleazarus contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned death, to defende that faſt which God had then commanded in the Church. And the ſeauen brethren in the Machabees, with their Mother aboue meaſure maruelous, paſſed through cruell torments in defence of the ſame faſt. In the New Teſtament we haue faſting much more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs by the example of Chriſt himſelfe, who bleſſedly beganne the Law of grace with his owne faſt of forty dayes. We haue alſo that Anne the Prophetiſſe faſted, that S. Iohn Baptiſt faſted, that the Apoſtles faſted, and that Chriſt did not onely commende faſting by his example, but in plane words and by miracle. He would haue a poſſeſſed perſon to be brought to the Apoſtles, that they labouring in vaine to deſpoſſeſſe him, he might performe it himſelfe, and then declare for faſting: ſaying, <hi>this kind can goe out by nothing but by prayer and faſting.</hi>

What more could an haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike ſay to deny the doctrine of the whole world? and what more could theeues, robbers and all wicked malefactors deſire, to exempt themſelues from all humane lawes, and obligation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then to deny all obſeruations as of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of man, and to referre all to the tribunal of God, which they know that they can not eſcape, but muſt ſtande to whether they will or noe? You may ſee what reuerence is here to the word of God, and how eaſily that ſacred word is abuſed by thoſe that will ſtande againſt the whole Church. Firſt therefor I tell them that they cannot but ſee thoſe words to haue the ſame force againſt faſting in generall, which commonly they allow of, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the faſts of the Church, which now they reiect; but that is indeede noe force at all, the circumſtances being altered in which Chriſt ſpoke them, to reprooue the faſts of vaine, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryticall men, who faſted without order and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, for shew onely. Secondly I tell them that the authority of the Church is the authority of
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:98706:347"/>God, as I haue ſufficiently prooued; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the Praecepts of the Church are not onely the obſeruations of men, but the Commandements of God. Thirdly I tell them that God by his Church commanded faſting in the Law of Moyſes, and in the Law of grace, euen in the Apoſtles times, the Councell of Hieruſalem prohibiting ſome meates,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note> as is ſpecifyed in the fifteenth of the acts. Fourthly I tell them that faſting as it is a Praecept of the Church is vſed, as a corporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to ſubdue the euill inclinations of our flesh; and corporall afflictions vſed with order, as the Church praeſcribeth them, are pleaſing to God; therefor faſting as it is a Praecept of the Church is pleaſing to God.

<pb n="651" facs="tcp:98706:347"/>vertue was eſteemed of euen by heathens in the beſt ages of the world; who ſaw by reaſon, and founde by experience the force of faſting, in the tempering of our bodys, in refreshing and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of our vnderſtandings, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in diſpoſing vs vnto Morall vertues And writing to the Virgin Demetrias he hath this high expreſſion that <hi>faſting is not onely in it ſelfe a perfect vertue, but the foundation, ſanctification, purity, and Prudence of the reſt; without which none shall ſee God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the particular faſts or abſtinences which the holy Church commandeth. There are the forty dayes faſt of Lent, the faſt of Ember dayes, of Rogation dayes, of Vigils, of Frydayes of S. Marke,
<note place="margin">Lent.</note> and of Saturdayes We haue for the forty dayes faſt of Lent the examples of Moyſes, of Elias, and of Chriſt himſelfe. Moyſes faſted forty dayes, and receiued the Law enioying in that time the familiar conuerſation of God. Elias faſted forty dayes, and then wrought miracles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing the dead. Chriſt faſted forty dayes in the beginning of his miraculous preaching, ſoe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelfe to deliuer his ghoſpell, and to redeeme the world. And although we can not faſt ſoe ſtrictly and perfectly as our bleſſed Sauiour did, eating nothing all that time; yet it is fitting that we should doe our endeauour in honour and imitation of him. And it is not vnlikely that Chriſt commended the faſt of Lent as well by word and expreſſe commande, as by example to his Apoſtles in thoſe forty dayes ſpace betwixt his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, in which he often
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:98706:348"/>appeared to them, and taught them concerning the Church; and therefor the auncient and holy fathers commonly call it the inſtitution of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by the Commandement of Chriſt. S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe <hi>that it was not inuented by any earthly cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation but commanded by the heauenly maieſty.</hi>

It is inſtituted to be kept againſt the Paſſion of Chriſt, that we, who profeſſe ourſelues his ſeruants, and ſouldiers, may in ſome ſort ſuffer with our maſter, and captaine. It were a prepoſterous mirth and abſurde in a ſeruant to laugh, and make merry, when he ſaw his maſter full of paine; or for a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to take his eaſe in bedd, when his captaine were enduring hardneſſe in the field. Good Vrias comming out of the campe to the court, the King badd him to goe home and reſt himſelfe; but he refuſed to doe ſoe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.11.</note> ſaying <hi>the arke of God</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And my Lord Ioah abide vpon the face of the earth and shall I enter into my houſe to eate and drinke? I will not doe this thinge.</hi> Neither did he it; but went out and ſlept before the gates of the Kings houſe with the other ſeruants of his Lord; becauſe he would not pamper himſelfe and ly within doores, when the arke, and his Lord laid without. Our bleſſed Lord the King of heauen and earth, the Sauiour of
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:98706:348"/>the world is ſuffering many blowes, he is bleeding vpon the Croſſe, his meate, and drinke is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agre, and gall, and is it then a time for vs to make merry, and to feaſt our ſelues? is this like a ſeruant and ſouldier of Chriſt? or is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt vnſeaſonable, prepoſterous, and ſpire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vnworthy of the name and profeſſion of a Chriſtian? how prepoſterous then is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of thoſe who chooſe the time of Lent of all the times of the yeare, and Good Friday of all the dayes in lent to make their feaſts on? is this a good preparation to receiue the benefit of Chriſts Paſſion and Reſurrection? if they were Iewes or profeſſed enemyes of Chriſt they might doe ſoe indeed in deſpite of him; but being Chriſtians they should be ashamed of it. Saint Auguſtine commendeth the faſt of Lent, as a preparation for Eaſter, and ſaith as you haue heard, that the breaking of it is wicked, and proper to Infidels, and Haeretiks. This they may gloſſe with ſome pretence, and finde ſome thing to ſay for it, as may be done for any abſurdity whatſoeuer; but the commune ſenſe? and the firſt apprehenſion of all men conceiueth it moſt naturall to ſorrow with the ſorrowfull, and abhorreth the contrary as a diſdaine and affront: and Chriſt will diſdaine thoſe that diſdaine him, and deſpiſe thoſe that deſpiſe his Church. Baronius relateth of Saint Elphegus Bishop of Wincheſter how that exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people to obſerue Lent, a certaine man derided him; but the Bishop foretold that he should dy that night, and ſo it happened. Lent then is obſerued in imitation of our Lords faſt,
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:98706:349"/>in honour of his Paſſion, and as a preparation for Eaſter. The Sundayes in Lent are not of the number of the forty dayes faſt, although we keepe abſtinence on them alſo; that the forty dayes may continue in ſome kind of faſting all together, and not be quite broken by eating of flesh within that time.
<note place="margin">Ember dayes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Ember dayes were faſted as a preparation for holy Orders, which at thoſe times vſed to be giuen Saint Hierome writing to Marcella ſayeth that the Ember dayes, as well as lent were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Apoſtles.

               </p>
               <p>Rogation dayes are faſted for the fruits of the earth. Proceſſion is made that the whole Church both Clergy and Laity may be repreſented as preſent to acknowledge the goodneſſe of God, and his prouidence ouer vs, and to pray for the continuance of it towards vs.
<note place="margin">Vigils.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Vigils are faſted inhonour of the day follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, that it being a holy day dedicated to prayer, faſting and prayer may goe both togother for the
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:98706:349"/>greater honour of God. They are called Vigils which is to ſay watchings; becauſe aunciently the faithfull vſed to watch all that night, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church to the Eccleſiaſticall office; but many inconueniences in proceſſe of time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in thoſe watchings, they were layed aſide.

               <p>The feaſt and ſolemnity of Saint Marke was firſt inſtituted by occaſion of a great peſtilence,
<note place="margin">S. Marke</note> which reigned ſo violently in Italy, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about Rome, that people ſuddainly fell downe dead, as they ſneized or yawned. And from thence ſaith Durandus came the cuſtome of ſaying; <hi>God bleſſe you,</hi> to thoſe that ſneize, as being then in danger of death. Saint Pelagius who was then Pope inſtituted the ſolemnity of Saint Marke againſt it, and himſelfe died of it, as he was going in the Proceſſion. Saint Gregory who ſucceeded him commanded it to be kept all ouer, and therefore it is called the great Letany, that is to ſay a greater ſupplication, (for Letany is as much as to ſay a ſupplication, or petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God) and ſo the abſtinence, Proceſſion, and the whole ſolemnity may be vnderſtoode as a ſupplication thus inſtituted. The ſolemnity of Rogation dayes is called the leſſer Letany, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were firſt begunne more priuatly, and by a leſſer authority; to wit of the Bishop of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna: Thus Durand.</p>
               <p>Saturdays abſtinence is kept in honour of our bleſſed Lady, in remembrance of that Saturday,
<note place="margin">Saturday</note>
                  <pb n="656" facs="tcp:98706:350"/>on which the ſacred body of our Lord remained in the Sepulcher; for the Faith of Chriſt was then preſerued eſpecially by her, the Apoſtles at that time wauering in the beleefe of his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This as all other Praecepts of the Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth according to the intention of the Church commanding it.
<note place="margin">How we are to faſt</note> For he that maketh lawes is to interprete his meaning in them; who as he could giue them power to oblige; ſo is he to determine the circumſtances of their obligation. Hence it followeth firſt that ſicke folkes, children, and youths before they come to a ſufficient ſetled growth, aged and decayed perſons, poore people that muſt eate often, as not hauing ſufficient at once for an intire maile, and thoſe that labour much in body or minde, are not bounde to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Becauſe the Praecepts of the Church are to bee vnderſtoode vnto edification and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction: that is to ſay they are intended to raiſe the honour of God, by increaſing of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deuotion; but they should pull it downe and leſſen it, if they obliged with any notable hurt. And therefore faſting and all ſuch corporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are to be vſed with diſcretion, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and oblige not vnto our hurt or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table damage. Saint Paul was a great lover of ſuch afflictions, and no doubt but he was glad to ſee his diſciple Timothy to follow him in them; yet when he ſaw that it was with exceſſe, and to the impairing of his health,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.</note> he aduiſed him, ſaying; <hi>Drinke not yet water, but vſe a litle wine for thy ſtomake, and thy often infirmitys.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:98706:350"/>it followeth that our faſt is broken with meate only, and not with drinke; which the Church might alſo haue forbidden, but did not: and therefore it is lawfull to drinke betwixt mailes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wine, beere, water, or any thing which is vſed as drinke. Milke betwixt mailes breaketh the faſt; becauſe it is rather meate then drinke; and therefore we commonly call it, as the Scripture alſo doth, <hi>te cate milke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Praecept of faſting includeth two things,
<note place="margin">Two things in faſting.</note> to wit to abſtaine from vnlawfull meates, and to eate but one maile of lawfull meates The firſt bindeth all that are ſubiect to the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cepts of the Church: that is all that are capable of reaſon. The ſecond obligeth only thoſe that are of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtrength, and ſufficient ability, and not ſuch as are mentioned aboue, who may eate more mailes then one ſo that they abſteine from mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes prohibited. It is a cuſtome in ſome places to eate bread and drinke on faſting dayes in the morning: which in ſeruants, and others that are not bound to faſt is allowable and very good; becauſe their faſting is a voluntary obſequy in them, who not being able nor bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerue ſtrictly the faſt of the Church, it is to be vnderſtoode that of deuotion they will abſteine from a compleate breakfaſt, and content them ſelues with onely bread and drinke; but in thoſe that are bound to faſt, I know not how to allow of it. It proceedeth alſo as I ſuppoſe out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſome, that they eate aples, and fruit out of maile time on faſting dayes. I tell th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="658" facs="tcp:98706:351"/>dayes our of maile time, and take ſome thing to quench their thirſt, becauſe the Church hath not forbidden to drinke; but it hath forbidden to eate all kind of meate; and therefore aple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and fruit are not to be eaten out of mailes.</p>
               <p>Faſting dayes beginne at twelue a clocke in the morning, and end at twelue a clocke at night, conteining fower and twenty houres. Aunciently they faſted from ſupper time on the day before; till ſupper time againe, on the next day, without eating of any thing: but mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions growing weaker, and weaker, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their deuotions alſo, they beganne to take their ſuppers ſooner on faſting dayes, vntill by litle and litle, they brought ſupper to noone time: and cuſtome hath now preuailed to take a litle collation at night, as is obſerued in the Church. So that the maile which we haue on faſting dayes is not properly a dinner, but a ſupper; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may lawfully be differred as late as we will; but it may not be taken before the time allowed of by cuſtome. Which is at ſooneſt about noone time.</p>
               <p>Finally,

For our conſcience is the iudgment which we make of euery particular action which we doe: which iudgment being giuen vs of God as a guide to direct vs in his diuine Law, we are bounde to follow it and to be directed by it.

<note place="margin">The firſt euill of ſinne.</note> and that it is an incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible and infinite euill, in that it is contrary to God, and ſeparating from him, an incomprehenſible and infinite good. For what is God? but an infinite power, an infinite wiſdome, an infinite goodnes, beauty, and glory? nor can we ſay any thinge of God, but by infinites. Then what is ſinne, as it is contrary to God, but an infinite of all euills contrary to that infinite good? he that could lay what God were and could declare the goodnes of God, might ſay what ſinne were and declare the euill of it: but this none at all can doe; and therefor the euills of ſinne are vnſpeakeable, and as the goodnes of God ſoe are they incomprehenſible, in that they ſeparate vs from him. Thinke with your ſelues ſometimes of that ſupreme goodnes, contemplate God and bleſſe him whom you can neither ſpeake not thinke.

There was not any thing in the world which the Saints of God haue feared ſoe much, nor indeede any other thing which they feared but ſinne. The Embaſſadours of Eudoxia ſeeing that by noe threates they could obtaine of Saint Iohn Chryſoſtome ſome things which the Empreſſe demanded obſtinatly of him, returned with this anſwere to her, that Chryſoſtome was a man that feared none but God.

               <p>Thirdly by ſinne we incurre many temporall afflictions in this world: which although they be
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:98706:364"/>neither in duration of time, nor in intentions, and violence of paine to compare with thoſe of the ſoule, which are ſpirituall and eternal; yet in reaſon it should be a great motiue, eſpecially to wordly men, who ſeeke after temporal felicitys to fly ſinne, which is the loſſe and hinderance of them. A man committeth ſome great ſinne, and within a while he is ſtrucken with ſickneſſe, greifes, or hurts, by which he remaineth woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, lame, and miſcrable, perhaps for many weekes, and months, and perhaps for all his life time: another ſinneth, and is punished with the death of wife or children: another receiueth ſome affront, and pineth away with greefe, and malice that he can not reuenge himſelfe: another hath his houſe burned, or robbed: another hath his croppe waſted, and deſtroyed. Another hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and loſſes in his cattell: and a thouſand kindes of temporall punishments are iuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon men for their ſinnes, and come not by chance, as ſome would perſwade themſelues. For God ſeeeth the malice of all our actions; and becauſe he will not publish them vntill the day of iudgment, he punisheth them with ſuch afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as are commune to all, to bring vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. This doctrine is prooued by that which Chriſt ſaid to the man, whom he cured of eight and thirty yeares infirmity.

It were to deſtroy all orders and to make God the cauſe of diſordering the whole world, if men might doe what they would in hopes of pardon. It is true the mercy of God is aboue all his works, and more then his iuſtice in this, that he sheweth it more, pardoning often, before he once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne: but his iuſtice alſo shall be fullfilled.

What an example of the iuſtice of God was that vpon Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſoe holy a man, and of all men that euer were the ſpeciall figure of Chriſt our Redeemer; yet for an offence ſoe ſmall, that authors hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish in what it conſiſted he was depriued of that which aboue all thinges in this world, he had moſt reaſon to deſire: to wit to ſee the Land of promiſe in the poſſeſſion of the Iſraelites, and the true worship of God flourishing in it; euen as good Catholikes commonly deſire to ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of England to the Catholike faith, and God truely worshipped in it; but that as his zeale was greater then ours, ſoe was the deſire: which he had of that, greater then ours is of this: yet he neuer obtained it; but euen then when it ſeemed to be ſoe neere, that he had brought the people vnto the borders of the Land, and as it were to the very laſt ſteppe into it, they were drawne backe againe, and he muſt neuer haue the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſee them in it. <hi>When</hi> (ſaith S.

And when I ſee him ſoe often praying, and ſtill praying in vaine; and when I conſider that all thoſe great works which he did could not auaile to procure his pardon, for ſoe short a word.

               <p>But he ſaith that he intendeth to repent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after ſin.

But how doth he know that he shall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it, ſeeing that he can not aſſure himſelfe of a moment of life after ſinne to repent in? How many chances is this life of ours ſubiect vnto, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and eaſily broken, as a ſpiders webbe? how many dy ſuddenly, and (if they be in ſinne) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance? ſome by ſuddaine diſeaſes, ſome murthered, ſome drowned, ſome killed acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally by chances, which we heare of euery day. And how many eſpecially in England haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired at their deaths the aſſiſtance of a Prieſt, and could not obtaine it? All theſe hazards doth the ſinner vndergoe, and one greater then them all, to wit that ſuppoſe he hath time of repentance

They would be ashamed to be brought to deny that, which all Philoſophers had ſetled; and are
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:98706:375"/>ashamed to deny that which Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt, and all the Doctors of the Catholike Church haue taught and eſtablished in faith: but one arch haeretike will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict them all, and gette followers to mainteine his ſingularity againſt them. Thus did Simon Magus beginne firſt to teach that God is the authour of ſinne: not that he was the immediate cauſer of it; but in that he had giuen vs ſuch a nature, as that we ſinned of neceſſity, and could not but ſinne. Which commeth to be the ſame as to deny freewill. Cerdon and Cerinthus followed him in this blaſphemy, that God is the authour of ſinne. Yet it had ſoe ill a ſound in their eares to impute ſinne vnto God, who is infinitly good; that they would imagine another God, whom they called the euill God; and to him they imputed the euill of ſinne.

               <p>The inordinate affection of creatures is the cauſe of ſinne, and men are the authors of the ſinnes which they committe.

Pelagius an auncient and very learned authour but a prowde and obſtinate haeretike, was ſoe farre contrary to this doctrine, that where as they deny free power to man to doe good works with Gods grace, he affirmed that we haue not onely free power to doe good with Gods grace; but alſo of ourſelues without it.

<pb n="710" facs="tcp:98706:377"/>onely, but by the diuine grace: which is contrary to Pelagius. The Manichaeans, Lutherans, and thoſe that deny freewill make voide the ſeauenth article of the Creede, that Chriſt is our iudge, and the Pelagions make him noe Sauiour.</p>
               <p>The Catholike Church hath allwais taught that man hath freewill to doe well by cooperating with Gods grace; or to doe ill by reiecting it.

This was the doctrine of the Catholike Church aboue a thouſand and foure hundred yeares ſince, when Manes beganne to oppoſe it, and he was then,
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:98706:378"/>and hath euer ſince bene eſteemed an haeretike for oppoſing it; there being then noe Church of Chriſtians in all the world that denyed it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for this is the true Catholike doctrine. This was the doctrine of the Church a few yeares ſince when Luther beganne to oppoſe it;

Let now the enemys of the Catholike Church obiect what they can, either out of Scriptures or reaſon againſt it, all is in vaine: the Church is to iudge of the ſenſe of Scriptures, and of reaſon, and not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry priuate man to vnderſtande them as he will, and to get followers to himſelfe againſt the Church. Whatſoeuer is obiected contrary to the authority of the vniuerſall Church allthough it ſeeme neuer ſoe plane, is wrong and falſly applyed, and we muſt take them for haeretikes that will ſtande ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in any ſuch doctrine.

<pb n="713" facs="tcp:98706:378"/>iudge who hath lawfull authority.

Therefore we neede noe more for the proofe of freewill but the authority of the Church; and all arguments that can be obiected againſt it are but deluſions.

               </p>
               <p>THE firſt diuiſion of ſinne may be into O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal and Actuall. And although Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne were Actuall as it was acted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Adam: and were Mortall in that it brought death both to him, and vs: yet for more cleerenes we will deſtinguish firſt Original, and Actuall; and then Mortall, and Veniall ſinne.</p>
               <p>Original ſinne is that which we contract from Adam our Origen, and which we committe not ourſelues; but bring into the world with vs. Adam was placed in paradiſe, his ſoule endowed with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall iuſtice, and in his body he was immortall. He had the commande of all earthly creatures, enioying freely the pleaſures of them; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dying should haue bene transferred after a time to the pleaſures of heauen. Theſe gifts were giuen to him and his poſterity; and they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely had obtained them, if they had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:98706:380"/>but he ſinning, we are depriued of that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall iuſtice, and other gifts: and the wart and priuation of them is called Originall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in vs.</p>
               <p>We haue noe wrong done vs in this that we are borne depriued of our fathers gifts; becauſe they were giuen to him, and his poſterity onely vpon condition that they ſinned not. As though a King of his owne freewill should beſtow ſome place of honour, and benefit, vpon a ſubiect, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his poſterity to enioy after him, vpon condition that they allwais kept themſelues obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and loyall to him; but if he or any of them should be found guilty of treaſon, then they should looſe that place and benefit. Now he or ſome of them breaking the condition by diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, they are iuſtly depriued of that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. Soe the gifts and graces which God gaue to Adam for himſelfe, and for vs, were noe way due, but of the goodnes, and liberality of God, and granted conditionally, if we remained loyall to him; we committing treaſon are iuſtly depriued of thoſe gifts, which he had, and are borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. The reaſon of this is, becauſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and children in this caſe are as it were all one man, and haue as it were all one will: and as that which is done by one onely part of man, to wit by his will is attributed to the whole man, and punished in all the reſt of his parts; ſoe the ſinne which was committed by Adam is iuſtly punished in all men; becauſe all men were his children, and as it were one man in him. A ſpend thrift father waſteth his eſtate not onely from himſelfe, but
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:98706:380"/>alſo from his children; becauſe they are ſuppoſed, and are indeede in riches one body, and one min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de with him, and can blame none but him who conſumed thoſe riches which they should haue had. Soe all men in Adam were one man, his will was the will of all, he conſumed the riches which we should haue had, and we are iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of them.</p>
               <p>Actuall ſinne is that which we committe:
<note place="margin">Actuall ſinne.</note> and is therefor called Actuall, becauſe we act it our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and bring it not originally into the world with vs. And ſoe the ſinne which Adam commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and which is original in vs, was Actuall in him; becauſe he acted it, and had it not by infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from another, as we haue from him.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How many kindes of Actuall ſinne are there?</hi> Anſ. <hi>There are two kindes of Actuall ſinne. Mortall ſinne, and Veniall ſinne.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>MORTALL ſinne is as much as to ſay Deadly ſinne. It is a mortall, and deadly

We can not expreſſe nor conceiue with ſufficient horrour the ſtate of our ſoules, when they are in mortall ſinne. Our bodys when they are dead become pale, cold and ghaſtly, but much more our ſoules in deadly ſinne. We behold with horrour the body of one that had killed, drowned, or hanged himſelfe: and it is not a horrour to kill our owne ſoules. If any of this company should now ſuddainely fall downe, and dy before vs, we should all be terrifyed and affrighted at it: then how should we feare to fall into mortall ſinne, by which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly killed and dead?

                  </note> Victorinus whilſt he liued in the wildernes being drawne into the ſinne of fornication by a wicked deluſion of the deuill, was ſoe vexed in conſcience afterwards, that faſtening his hands into a peece of clouen wood, he liued three yeares with onely raw herbes and water. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he wrought miracles, became a bishop and at laſt a glorious martyr. The Magdalen moued to repentance came preſently into the Phariſys houſe,

                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.</note> and was not ashamed to weepe in publike ſoe many teares, that she washed the feete of Chriſt with them. S. Peter after his ſinne went out preſently <hi>and wept bitterly.</hi> And ſoe great was his ſorrow euer after, that he is recorded by S. Clement, who liued with him,
<note place="margin">Clem. in recognit.</note> to haue carried allwais in his hand a litle linnen napkin to dry his
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:98706:382"/>face from teares. But the example of our Sauiour weeping for the ſinnes of others should moue vs more, then theſe who wept for their owne ſinnes. Chriſt as he came downe Mount Oliuet hauing before his eyes a full view of the city of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, was ſtrucken with ſuch an apprehenſion of the ſinnes of that people, that beginning to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke he was interrupted with teares, and could not goe on for weeping. And he wept alſo for Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus long dead and putrifyed, that was to ſignify the ſinner dead and putrifyed in long continued ſinnes, that we might ſee how much he loued our ſoules; and how he lamenteth at their ſpirituall death.

Grant vs O Lord that we may ſaue our ſoules, the whole world beſide we will looſe it willingly. And this is the effect of mortall ſinne, that he that committeth but one, and dyeth in it, is as ſure to ſuffer shippwracke of his ſoule, and to be damned into hell, as though he were guilty of all the mortall ſinnes in the world,

<pb n="721" facs="tcp:98706:382"/>great, and great ſinnes litle ones, and ſometimes noe ſinnes at all. Beſides God will not haue vs to know for certaine whether we be in ſtate of grace or noe: according to that of Eccleſiaſtes, <hi>Man knoweth not whether he be worthy of loue or hatred</hi> and Iob, <hi>allthough I shall be ſimple,</hi>

               <p>Veniall is as much as to ſay eaſily pardonable: and ſoe a Veniall ſinne is a ſinne which eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth pardon. A litle ſinne which diminisheth the feruour of diuine grace in vs; but taketh not the grace of God from vs ſoe as to put vs in ſtate of damnation. It maketh vs to grow colder, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in deuotion, and diſpoſeth by litle and litle to ſome mortall ſinne, and then by that we looſe quite the diuine grace, and are in ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Soe that Mortall ſinne is quite oppoſite and incompatible with the diuine grace: Veniall ſinne is compatible and may ſtande with it. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors commonly declare this by the ſimilitude of a traueler going out of his way. He may either goe a quite contrary way, or he may goe wrong, yet not quite contrary to the right way. By Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne we goe the quite contrary way from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to wit to hell: by Veniall ſinne we goe not to hell, yet we goe wrong and out of the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. S. Auguſtine compareth Veniall ſinnes to
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:98706:383"/>ſcabbs that deforme and disfigure the body, but kill it not; ſoe Veniall ſinne deformeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisheth the beauty of our ſoules; but leaueth them ſtill with ſpirituall life.
